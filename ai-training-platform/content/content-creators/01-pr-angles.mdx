# Building and Validating PR Angles

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Use AI to brainstorm 20+ PR angles in minutes
- Validate the "newsworthiness" of an angle before pitching
- Draft press releases that journalists actually read
- Customise pitches for specific publications

## The PR Problem

Journalists are drowning in bad pitches.
To stand out, you need a "Hook" that is:
1.  **Timely**: Why now?
2.  **Relevant**: Why does their audience care?
3.  **Unique**: What's the fresh take?

AI is the perfect brainstorming partner for finding these hooks.

## Brainstorming Angles

Don't stare at a blank page.
Prompt:
> "I am launching a new app that helps people track their water intake.
> Act as a cynical tech journalist.
> Give me 10 headlines that would actually make you click.
> Avoid generic marketing fluff. Focus on trends, controversy, or data."

### The "Trend Jacking" Technique
Ask AI to monitor current news and find a connection.
> "What are the top health trends in Australia this week? How can I connect 'hydration' to one of these trends in a counter-intuitive way?"

## Drafting the Release

AI writes great first drafts, but terrible final drafts.
Use it to get the structure right.

**Standard PR Structure:**
1.  **Headline**: Punchy and factual.
2.  **Dateline**: City, Country – Date.
3.  **Lede**: The most important info (Who, what, when, where, why).
4.  **Quote**: A human voice adding colour.
5.  **Call to Action**: Where to find more info.

Prompt:
> "Draft a press release based on these notes. Use the standard AP style. Keep the tone professional but energetic. Keep the lede under 40 words."

## Practical Exercise: The Pitch Perfect

### Task
Choose a recent TBS project or a hypothetical client.
1.  Generate 5 distinct PR angles (e.g., The Data Angle, The Human Interest Angle, The Tech Angle).
2.  Select the best one.
3.  Draft a 200-word email pitch to a specific journalist (invent one).

### Questions to Consider
- Did the AI capture the "voice" of the pitch?
- Is the angle actually interesting, or just "news" to you?
- Would you open that email?

## Next Steps

You have the story. Now you need the content to back it up.
