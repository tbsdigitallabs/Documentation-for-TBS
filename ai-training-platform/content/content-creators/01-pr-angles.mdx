# Building and Validating PR Angles

Welcome! If you've ever tried to get media coverage for a client or your own company, you know how hard it can be. Journalists receive hundreds of pitches every day, and most get ignored.

**This module will teach you:** How to use AI to brainstorm PR angles that actually get attention, validate whether your story is newsworthy, and draft press releases that journalists will actually read (and maybe even write about!).

*'PR: Trying to get journalists to care. AI: I can help with that. You: Finally, someone who understands!'*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Use AI to brainstorm 20+ PR angles in minutes (not hours!)
- Validate the 'newsworthiness' of an angle before pitching
- Draft press releases that journalists actually want to read
- Customise pitches for specific publications and journalists

## The PR Problem (Why Most Pitches Fail)

Let's be honest about the reality of PR:

**The situation:**
- Journalists are drowning in bad pitches
- Most emails get deleted without being read
- Generic press releases go straight to spam
- 'News' that's only news to you isn't news to them

**To stand out, you need a "Hook" that is:**
1. **Timely**: Why now? What's happening in the world that makes this relevant?
2. **Relevant**: Why does their audience care? What problem does this solve?
3. **Unique**: What's the fresh take? What haven't we heard before?

**The solution:** AI is the perfect brainstorming partner for finding these hooks. It can think like a journalist, challenge your assumptions, and help you find angles you never considered.

*'Journalists: *drowning in bad pitches* You: But my product is amazing! AI: Let me help you explain why anyone should care.'*

## Brainstorming Angles (Don't Stare at a Blank Page)

Don't waste hours staring at a blank page. Let AI help you brainstorm!

### The Basic Technique

**Instead of:** "Write a press release about my new app"

**Do this:**
> "I am launching a new app that helps people track their water intake. Act as a cynical tech journalist. Give me 10 headlines that would actually make you click. Avoid generic marketing fluff. Focus on trends, controversy, or data."

**What you get:**
- Headlines from a journalist's perspective
- Angles you might not have thought of
- Focus on what actually matters (not just features)
- Realistic assessment of what's interesting

**Example output:**
- "New Study: 80% of Australians Dehydrated—This App Claims to Fix It"
- "Water Tracking App Sparks Debate: Is Technology Replacing Common Sense?"
- "Melbourne Startup Raises $2M to Solve a Problem You Didn't Know You Had"

**See?** Much more interesting than "New Water Tracking App Launches"!

![Brainstorming](/images/brainstorming.jpg)
*'You: I need PR angles. AI: *acts as cynical journalist* AI: Here are 10 headlines that would make me click. You: These are way better than what I had!'*

### The "Trend Jacking" Technique

Connect your story to what's happening right now.

**How it works:**
> "What are the top health trends in Australia this week? How can I connect 'hydration' to one of these trends in a counter-intuitive way?"

**What you get:**
- Current trends that are actually relevant
- Creative connections you might not have seen
- Timely angles that journalists are already writing about

**Example:**
- Current trend: "Mental health awareness week"
- Connection: "New research shows dehydration affects mental clarity—water tracking app helps office workers stay sharp"
- Angle: "Mental Health Week: The Surprising Link Between Hydration and Productivity"

**The key:** Find the unexpected connection that makes your story relevant to what's already in the news.

*'Trend Jacking: Connecting your story to what's already in the news. AI: I can help you find those connections. You: Perfect timing!'*

## Drafting the Release (Structure Matters!)

AI writes great first drafts, but terrible final drafts. Use it to get the structure right, then refine it yourself.

### The Standard PR Structure

Every press release should follow this structure:

1. **Headline**: Punchy and factual (not marketing fluff)
2. **Dateline**: City, Country – Date (e.g., "Sydney, Australia – 15 January 2024")
3. **Lede**: The most important info (Who, what, when, where, why) - keep it under 40 words
4. **Quote**: A human voice adding colour (from CEO, customer, expert)
5. **Call to Action**: Where to find more info (website, contact details)

### How to Use AI for Drafting

**Step 1:** Gather your information (what happened, who's involved, why it matters)

**Step 2:** Ask AI:
> "Draft a press release based on these notes. Use the standard AP style. Keep the tone professional but energetic. Keep the lede under 40 words. Include a quote from the CEO about why this matters."

**Step 3:** Review and refine
- Is the headline actually interesting?
- Does the lede answer the 5 W's?
- Is the quote natural (not robotic)?
- Does it sound like marketing or actual news?

**Step 4:** Edit for your voice and brand

![Press Release](/images/press-release.jpg)
*'AI: *drafts press release* You: *reviews* Also you: Good structure, but let me make it sound more human. Result: Perfect press release!'*

## Validating Newsworthiness (Before You Pitch)

Before you send that pitch, make sure it's actually newsworthy!

### The Validation Test

**Ask AI:**
> "I'm planning to pitch this story: [your angle]. Act as a busy journalist who receives 100 pitches a day. Would you write about this? Why or why not? Be honest."

**What to look for:**
- Does AI think it's interesting?
- What concerns does it raise?
- What would make it more newsworthy?
- Is the timing right?

**If AI says no:** Don't give up! Ask:
> "What would make this story newsworthy? What angle would you actually write about?"

**Use this feedback** to refine your angle before pitching.

![Validation](/images/validation.jpg)
*'You: Is this newsworthy? AI Journalist: *honest feedback* You: Okay, let me fix that. Also you: Now it's actually interesting!'*

---

## Customising Pitches (One Size Doesn't Fit All)

Different publications care about different things. Customise your pitch!

### Research the Publication

**Ask AI:**
> "I want to pitch to [Publication Name]. What types of stories do they typically cover? What's their editorial style? What would make them interested in a story about [your topic]?"

**What you get:**
- Understanding of what they care about
- Their editorial style
- Specific angles that would appeal to them

### Customise Your Pitch

**Then ask:**
> "Write a 200-word email pitch to [Journalist Name] at [Publication]. Reference a recent article they wrote about [related topic]. Connect my story to their interests. Keep it personal and specific."

**What you get:**
- A personalised pitch (not generic)
- Connection to their previous work
- Specific to their interests
- Much more likely to get a response

![Customised Pitch](/images/customised-pitch.jpg)
*'Generic Pitch: *gets deleted* Customised Pitch: *gets opened* Journalist: This person actually read my work. I'll respond.'*

## Your Practice Exercise: The Pitch Perfect

Ready to try this yourself? Let's create a complete PR package!

### The Challenge

Choose a recent TBS project (or make up a hypothetical client). Create a complete PR package.

### Step 1: Generate 5 Distinct PR Angles (15 minutes)

**Ask AI:**
> "I'm working on [project description]. Generate 5 distinct PR angles:
> 1. The Data Angle (statistics, research, numbers)
> 2. The Human Interest Angle (real people, stories, impact)
> 3. The Tech Angle (innovation, how it works)
> 4. The Trend Angle (connects to current events)
> 5. The Controversy Angle (challenges assumptions)
> 
> For each, write a headline that would make a journalist click."

**Review the angles:**
- Which ones feel most authentic?
- Which ones are actually interesting?
- Which ones fit your brand?

### Step 2: Select the Best One (5 minutes)

**Ask AI:**
> "Of these 5 angles, which is most newsworthy? Why? What would make it even better?"

**Pick the angle** that:
- Feels authentic to your story
- Is actually interesting (not just to you)
- Fits your brand voice
- Has a clear hook

### Step 3: Draft a 200-Word Email Pitch (10 minutes)

**Ask AI:**
> "Write a 200-word email pitch to [invent a journalist name] at [invent a publication]. Use the [selected angle]. Make it personal, specific, and compelling. Include:
> - A hook in the subject line
> - Why this matters now
> - What makes it unique
> - A clear call to action"

**Review the pitch:**
- Does it sound like a real person wrote it?
- Is it specific (not generic)?
- Would you open this email?

### Questions to Reflect On

- Did the AI capture the 'voice' of the pitch?
- Is the angle actually interesting, or just 'news' to you?
- Would you open that email if you were a journalist?
- How much time did this save vs. doing it manually?

![Pitch Perfect](/images/pitch-perfect.jpg)
*'Complete PR Package: 5 angles, validation, customised pitch. Time: 30 minutes. Manual: Would take 4 hours. You: I'm never going back!'*

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Generic Pitches

**The problem:** "We launched a new product" isn't news

**The solution:** Find the angle. What makes it interesting? Why now? Why should anyone care?

### Mistake #2: Not Researching the Journalist

**The problem:** Sending the same pitch to everyone

**The solution:** Research what they write about. Reference their work. Show you actually care.

### Mistake #3: Marketing Language

**The problem:** "Revolutionary," "game-changing," "industry-leading" (journalists hate this)

**The solution:** Use facts. Let the story speak for itself. Be specific, not hyperbolic.

### Mistake #4: Not Validating First

**The problem:** Pitching something that's only news to you

**The solution:** Always validate with AI (or a colleague) before pitching. Get honest feedback.

![Common Mistakes](/images/common-mistakes-pr.jpg)
*'Mistake: Generic pitch with marketing language. Result: Deleted. Solution: Specific angle, validated, customised. Result: Opened and responded to!'*
