# Creative Development and Content Systems

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Build a "Content Engine" that repurposes one idea into 10 formats
- Use AI to maintain brand voice consistency across channels
- Generate creative concepts for campaigns
- Automate the boring parts of content creation (tagging, formatting)

## The Content Treadmill

Feeding the social media beast is exhausting.
The solution isn't "work harder". It's "work systematically".
**COPE**: Create Once, Publish Everywhere.

## The AI Content Waterfall

Start with a "Pillar Piece" (e.g., a Podcast or a Whitepaper).
Use AI to cascade it down.

1.  **Transcribe**: Turn audio/video into text.
2.  **Summarise**: Create a blog post.
3.  **Extract**: Pull out 5 key quotes for Twitter/LinkedIn.
4.  **Script**: Write a script for a 60-second TikTok/Reel.
5.  **Visualise**: Generate image prompts for Midjourney/DALL-E.

### Maintaining Voice
Don't let AI sound like a robot.
Give it a "Style Guide" in the prompt.
> "Write in a tone that is: Professional but witty, Australian, concise. Avoid words like 'delve', 'landscape', and 'tapestry'. Use short sentences."

## Creative Concepting

AI is a great "Yes, And..." partner.
Prompt:
> "We need a visual concept for a cybersecurity brand.
> Idea 1: A digital fortress.
> Idea 2: A shield.
> Those are boring. Give me 10 abstract, metaphorical concepts that convey 'safety' without using locks or shields."

## Practical Exercise: The Waterfall

### Task
Take a 5-minute YouTube video (or a transcript of one).
Use AI to generate:
1.  A LinkedIn post (text only).
2.  An Instagram carousel plan (5 slides with text).
3.  A Newsletter blurb.

### Questions to Consider
- Did the content feel native to each platform?
- Did the core message survive the transformation?
- How much editing was required?

## Next Steps

You've mastered the creative systems.
Now go forth and create!
