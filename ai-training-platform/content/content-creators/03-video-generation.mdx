# Video Generation & Editing

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Turn a text script into a video storyboard using AI
- Generate B-roll footage from scratch using text-to-video tools
- Clone your voice (or a talent's voice) for instant dubbing
- Edit video by editing text (transcript-based editing)

## The Video Revolution

Video used to require a camera, lights, and a powerful PC.
Now it requires a script and an internet connection.

### 1. Text-to-Video Generation
Tools like **Runway Gen-2**, **Pika Labs**, and **Sora** (coming soon) allow you to conjure footage.
**Prompting for Video**:
> "Cinematic wide shot, drone view of Sydney Harbour Bridge at sunset, golden hour, 4k, highly detailed, slow motion."
**Camera Control**: Use terms like "pan left", "zoom in", "rack focus" to direct the AI camera.

### 2. AI Voice Synthesis
Need a voiceover but the talent is sick?
Tools like **ElevenLabs** offer indistinguishable voice cloning.
**Ethics**: Always get permission before cloning a real person's voice.
**Workflow**:
1.  Upload a 1-minute sample of the voice.
2.  Type your script.
3.  Adjust stability and clarity sliders.
4.  Download MP3.

### 3. Transcript-Based Editing
Tools like **Descript** or **Premiere Pro (Text-Based Editing)** change the game.
You don't cut the timeline. You cut the text.
Delete a word in the document -> The video clip is removed.
**Magic Feature**: "Remove Filler Words" (automatically deletes all "ums" and "ahs").

## Practical Exercise: The AI Commercial

### Task
Create a 15-second commercial for a fictional "Space Travel Agency".

1.  **Script**: Write a 3-line script.
2.  **Voice**: Generate a "Movie Trailer Guy" voiceover.
3.  **Visuals**: Generate 3 clips in Runway (Rocket launch, Starry sky, Happy family in space suit).
4.  **Edit**: Assemble them in your editor of choice.

### Questions to Consider
-   Did the lip-sync match (if you used avatars)?
-   How consistent was the visual style between clips?
-   Could this pass for a real TV ad?

## Next Steps

You've completed the Content Creator Track!
You now have the tools to:
1.  Find angles.
2.  Build systems.
3.  Generate video.
