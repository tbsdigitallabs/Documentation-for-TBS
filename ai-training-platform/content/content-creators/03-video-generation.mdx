# Video Generation & Editing

Welcome to the final content creator module! This one is about something that used to require expensive equipment and professional skills: **video creation**.

**This module will teach you:** How to turn text scripts into video storyboards, generate B-roll footage from scratch, clone voices for dubbing, and edit video by simply editing text. Think of it as having a video production studio in your browser.

## The Video Revolution (What's Changed?)

Let's talk about how video creation has changed:

### The Old Way (Why It Was Hard)

**Traditional video creation:**
- Need cameras, lights, microphones
- Need powerful computers for editing
- Need editing software (expensive!)
- Need filming locations
- Need actors or presenters
- Takes days or weeks
- Costs thousands of dollars

**The problem:**
- Video is powerful, but creation is expensive and time-consuming
- Most people can't create professional videos
- You're limited by equipment and skills

### The New Way (Using AI)

**AI-powered video creation:**
- Start with a script (text)
- Generate footage from text descriptions
- Clone voices for narration
- Edit by editing text
- No cameras needed
- No expensive equipment
- Takes hours, not days
- Costs much less

**The reality:**
Video used to require a camera, lights, and a powerful PC. Now it requires a script and an internet connection.

*'Old Way: Camera, lights, editing software, weeks of work. New Way: Script, AI, hours of work. You: This is the future!'*

## Technique 1: Text-to-Video Generation (Creating Footage from Scratch)

Need footage but don't have a camera? Generate it with AI!

### The Tools

**Text-to-video tools:**
- **Runway Gen-2** - High-quality video generation
- **Pika Labs** - Easy to use, good results
- **Sora 2** - OpenAI's video generator (most advanced, requires VPN for Australian users - see Tools & Best Practices module)

**What they do:**
- Turn text descriptions into video clips
- Generate B-roll footage
- Create scenes that would be expensive to film
- No cameras needed!

### How to Prompt for Video

**The key:** Be specific about camera movement and style.

**Example prompt:**
> "Cinematic wide shot, drone view of Sydney Harbour Bridge at sunset, golden hour, 4k, highly detailed, slow motion."

**What this creates:**
- A wide, cinematic shot
- Drone perspective (flying camera)
- Beautiful sunset lighting
- High quality (4k)
- Slow motion effect

### Camera Control Terms

Use these terms to direct the AI 'camera':

- **"Pan left"** or **"Pan right"** - Camera moves horizontally
- **"Zoom in"** or **"Zoom out"** - Camera moves closer or further
- **"Rack focus"** - Focus shifts from one object to another
- **"Dolly forward"** - Camera moves forward through space
- **"Tilt up"** or **"Tilt down"** - Camera angles up or down

**Example:**
> "Close-up of hands typing on keyboard, rack focus to screen showing code, slow zoom out to reveal office, natural lighting, professional style"

**See?** You're directing the camera with words!

![Text to Video](/images/text-to-video.jpg)
*'You: I need footage of a sunset over Sydney. AI: *generates video* You: Perfect! No camera, no travel, just words. This is magic!'*

## Technique 2: AI Voice Synthesis (Cloning Voices)

Need a voiceover but the talent is sick? Clone their voice (with permission)!

### The Tools

**Voice cloning tools:**
- **ElevenLabs** - High-quality, indistinguishable voice cloning
- **Murf** - Good for multiple voices
- **Play.ht** - Easy to use

**What they do:**
- Clone a voice from a sample
- Generate speech from text
- Adjust tone, speed, emotion
- Create voiceovers instantly

### The Workflow

**Step 1:** Get permission!

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Always get permission before cloning a real person's voice. This is ethical and legal.

**Step 2:** Upload a voice sample

**What you need:**
- 1 minute of clear audio
- The person speaking naturally
- Good quality (no background noise)
- Various sentences (not just one phrase)

**Step 3:** Type your script

**Enter the text** you want the voice to say.

**Step 4:** Adjust settings

**Controls:**
- **Stability**: How consistent the voice sounds (higher = more consistent)
- **Clarity**: How clear the speech is (higher = clearer)
- **Speed**: How fast it speaks

**Step 5:** Generate and download

**Result:** Professional voiceover in minutes, not hours!

![Voice Cloning](/images/voice-cloning.jpg)
*'Voice Talent: *sick* You: We need the voiceover today! AI: *clones voice* Result: Perfect voiceover, no delays. You: (with permission) This is amazing!'*

### Ethics Reminder

**Always:**
- Get written permission
- Use only for approved purposes
- Don't use for deception
- Respect the person's rights

**Never:**
- Clone without permission
- Use for malicious purposes
- Impersonate someone
- Violate trust

## Technique 3: Transcript-Based Editing (Edit Video by Editing Text)

This is a game-changer: edit video by editing text!

### The Tools

**Transcript-based editors:**
- **Descript** - The leader in this space
- **Premiere Pro** (Text-Based Editing) - Adobe's version
- **DaVinci Resolve** - Free alternative

**What they do:**
- Transcribe your video automatically
- Show transcript alongside video
- Let you edit by editing text
- Automatically update the video

### How It Works

**The magic:**
- Delete a word in the transcript → The video clip is removed
- Rearrange sentences → Video is rearranged
- Remove filler words → They're automatically deleted
- It's like editing a document, but it edits your video!

### The "Remove Filler Words" Feature

**The problem:** "Um," "ah," "like," "you know" - filler words everywhere

**The solution:**
Most transcript editors have a "Remove Filler Words" button. Click it, and all the "ums" and "ahs" are automatically deleted from your video.

**Time saved:** Hours of manual editing!

### Example Workflow

**Step 1:** Record your video (or upload existing)

**Step 2:** Get transcript automatically

**Step 3:** Edit the transcript:
- Delete sentences you don't want
- Rearrange paragraphs
- Fix mistakes
- Remove filler words

**Step 4:** Video automatically updates!

**Result:** Professional edit in minutes, not hours!

![Transcript Editing](/images/transcript-editing.jpg)
*'Video: *has mistakes and filler words* Transcript Editor: *removes them* Result: Clean, professional video. Time: 10 minutes. Manual editing: Would take 2 hours!'*

## Your Practice Exercise: The AI Commercial

Ready to create a complete video? Let's build a commercial!

### The Challenge

Create a 15-second commercial for a fictional "Space Travel Agency" using AI tools.

### Step 1: Write the Script (5 minutes)

**Task:** Write a 3-line script

**Example:**
```
Line 1: "Imagine booking your next holiday... in space."
Line 2: "Space Travel Agency makes intergalactic vacations a reality."
Line 3: "Book your cosmic adventure today at SpaceTravel.com"
```

**Keep it simple!** This is about learning the tools, not writing an Oscar winner.

### Step 2: Generate the Voiceover (10 minutes)

**Task:** Generate a "Movie Trailer Guy" voiceover

**Using ElevenLabs or similar:**
1. Find a voice sample (or use a default voice)
2. Enter your script
3. Adjust settings (dramatic, slow, powerful)
4. Generate and download

**Result:** Professional voiceover ready to use!

### Step 3: Generate Visuals (20 minutes)

**Task:** Generate 3 video clips in Runway or Pika Labs

**Clips needed:**
1. Rocket launch
2. Starry sky
3. Happy family in space suits

**Prompts:**
> "Cinematic shot of rocket launching into space, dramatic lighting, 4k, slow motion"

> "Wide shot of starry night sky, Milky Way visible, cinematic, 4k"

> "Happy family in space suits floating, zero gravity, joyful expressions, professional photography style"

**Generate each clip** and download them.

### Step 4: Assemble in Your Editor (15 minutes)

**Task:** Put it all together

**Using any video editor:**
1. Import your voiceover
2. Import your 3 video clips
3. Arrange them to match the script
4. Add text overlays if needed
5. Export your commercial!

### Step 5: Review and Refine (10 minutes)

**Questions to consider:**
- Does the lip-sync match? (If you used avatars)
- How consistent is the visual style between clips?
- Could this pass for a real TV ad?
- What would you improve?

![AI Commercial](/images/ai-commercial.jpg)
*'Complete Commercial: Script, voiceover, visuals, edited. Time: 60 minutes. Traditional: Would take days and cost thousands. You: This is the future of video!'*

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Not Getting Permission for Voice Cloning

**The problem:** Cloning voices without permission (illegal and unethical)

**The solution:** Always get written permission. Always.

### Mistake #2: Inconsistent Visual Styles

**The problem:** Each generated clip looks different

**The solution:** Use consistent prompts. Include style references. Generate multiple options and pick the best matches.

### Mistake #3: Over-Editing

**The problem:** Too many cuts, too much happening

**The solution:** Keep it simple. Let the story breathe. Less is often more.

### Mistake #4: Not Reviewing Generated Content

**The problem:** Using AI-generated content without checking

**The solution:** Always review. AI is helpful, but you're responsible for quality. Check for errors, inconsistencies, and appropriateness.
