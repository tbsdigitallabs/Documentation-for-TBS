# AI-Driven UI/UX Workflow

Welcome, designer! This module is all about using AI to speed up the boring parts of design so you can focus on what you love—creating beautiful, user-friendly experiences.

**Here's the truth:** AI won't replace designers. But it *will* replace spending 2 days finding the perfect inspiration image or writing 'Lorem Ipsum' for the 100th time.

*'Designer: I need inspiration. AI: Say no more. Designer: Wait, that's perfect. How did you...? AI: Magic.'*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Create mood boards in minutes instead of days
- Generate wireframes and sitemaps automatically
- Populate designs with realistic content (goodbye, Lorem Ipsum!)
- Create responsive layout variations quickly
- Use AI plugins in Figma to speed up your workflow

## The New Design Process (What's Changed?)

Let's talk about what AI actually does for designers.

### What AI Replaces: The Boring Stuff

**Old way:**
- Spend 2 days scrolling Pinterest for inspiration
- Manually create wireframes from scratch
- Write 'Lorem Ipsum' placeholder text everywhere
- Create multiple layout variations by hand

**New way:**
- Generate custom mood boards in 20 minutes
- AI creates wireframe structures automatically
- Realistic content generated instantly
- Multiple variations created with a few clicks

### What AI Can't Replace: Your Creativity

AI is a tool, not a replacement. You still need to:
- Make design decisions (colours, spacing, typography)
- Understand user needs and client requirements
- Create cohesive brand experiences
- Think strategically about user flows

**Think of AI as your design assistant**—it handles the tedious tasks so you can focus on the creative problem-solving.

![AI Assistant](https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/02022B/D56EED?text=Image)
*'AI: I'll handle the boring stuff. You handle the "why does this feel wrong?" questions.'*

## Your New Toolkit: AI Design Tools

Let's meet the tools that will change how you work. Don't worry—we'll start simple and build up.

### Midjourney / DALL-E (Image Generation)

**What they do:** Generate images from text descriptions

**Best for:**
- Mood boarding (create custom inspiration images)
- Style exploration (try different visual directions)
- Concept art (visualise ideas before building)

**Pro tip:** In Midjourney, use style references (`--sref`) to keep images consistent across a mood board.

**Example prompt:**
> "Modern minimalist website design, soft pastel colours, clean typography, luxury feel, --style raw"

![Mood Board](https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/02022B/D56EED?text=Image)
*'Before: 2 days of Pinterest scrolling. After: 20 minutes of AI generation.'*

### Relume (Wireframing & Sitemaps)

**What it does:** Generates wireframes and sitemaps from descriptions

**Best for:**
- Site architecture (organising pages and navigation)
- Wireframe generation (layout structures)
- Quick prototyping

**How it works:**
1. Paste your sitemap or project brief into Relume
2. It generates a full wireframe library
3. Export directly to Figma
4. You refine and add your design magic

**Think of it as:** A starting point that saves you hours of layout work.

### Figma AI Plugins (Your New Best Friends)

Figma has amazing AI plugins that work right inside your design tool:

**Magician**
- **What it does:** Generates icons, copy, and content
- **When to use:** Need placeholder icons? Need copy for buttons? Magician has you covered
- **Time saved:** Hours of searching for the right icon

**Automator**
- **What it does:** Batch operations (renaming, organising layers)
- **When to use:** Cleaning up messy files, organising components
- **Time saved:** Tedious manual work

**Attention Insight**
- **What it does:** Predicts where users will look (creates heatmaps)
- **When to use:** Before user testing, to validate your layout
- **Time saved:** Guessing where to place important elements

*'Figma: Now with AI superpowers. You: Finally, someone who understands my pain.'*

## Your First Practice: The 30-Minute Speed Run

Ready to see AI in action? Let's design a landing page in 30 minutes. Don't worry—this is about speed and learning, not perfection!

### The Challenge

Design a landing page for a **"Luxury Pet Hotel"** using AI tools.

### Step 1: Mood Board (5 minutes)

**Task:** Generate 4 images in Midjourney that define the colour palette and vibe.

**Prompt ideas:**
- "Luxury pet hotel interior, elegant, warm lighting, premium materials"
- "Happy pets in luxury setting, professional photography style"
- "Modern pet care facility, clean, welcoming, upscale"

**Goal:** Get a visual direction, not perfect images. These are for inspiration!

### Step 2: Wireframe (10 minutes)

**Task:** Use Relume (or similar tool) to generate the layout structure.

**What to include:**
- Hero section
- Services overview
- Testimonials
- Contact form
- Footer

**Don't overthink it!** Get a basic structure, then refine in Figma.

### Step 3: Content Generation (5 minutes)

**Task:** Use ChatGPT to write headlines and body copy.

**Prompt example:**
> "Write compelling copy for a luxury pet hotel landing page. Include: a hero headline, 3 service descriptions, and a call-to-action. Make it warm but professional."

**Result:** Real content instead of Lorem Ipsum!

### Step 4: Assembly (10 minutes)

**Task:** Bring everything into Figma and create a cohesive design.

**What to do:**
- Import your wireframe
- Add your mood board images for reference
- Use the AI-generated copy
- Apply your design skills to make it beautiful

### Questions to Think About

After you're done, reflect:
- Did AI struggle with specific UI elements? (Buttons, forms, etc.)
- How much time did you save vs. doing it manually?
- Is the design generic, or did you manage to inject personality?
- What would you do differently next time?

![Speed Run](https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/02022B/D56EED?text=Image)
*'30 minutes later: You have a complete landing page. Your boss: How?! You: AI magic. Also you: (quietly) And 10 years of design experience.'*

## Common Pitfalls (And How to Avoid Them)

### Pitfall #1: Over-Reliance on AI

**The problem:** Using AI for everything and losing your creative voice

**The solution:** Use AI for inspiration and structure, but make final decisions yourself

### Pitfall #2: Generic Designs

**The problem:** AI-generated designs can look similar to other AI-generated designs

**The solution:** Always add your unique touch—customise colours, spacing, typography

### Pitfall #3: Not Understanding the Tools

**The problem:** Trying to use every AI tool at once

**The solution:** Master one tool at a time. Start with mood boarding, then wireframes, then plugins

![Pitfalls](https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/02022B/D56EED?text=Image)
*'AI: I can generate anything! You: But can you make it not look like every other AI design? AI: ...touché.'*

## Next Steps

You've learned the basics! Here's what's next:

1. **Generative Assets**: Learn to create icons, illustrations, and graphics with AI
2. **Design Systems**: Use AI to build and maintain design systems
3. **Advanced Workflows**: Combine multiple AI tools for complex projects

**Remember:** Every designer learns at their own pace. If something doesn't work the first time, that's normal! Keep experimenting.
