# AI-Driven UI/UX Workflow

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Accelerate the "blank page" phase using AI mood boarding
- Generate sitemaps and wireframes in minutes, not hours
- Use AI to populate realistic content (no more Lorem Ipsum)
- Automate the creation of responsive layout variations

## The New Design Process

AI doesn't replace the designer. It replaces the *boring* parts of design.
Old Way: Spend 2 days finding inspiration images.
New Way: Spend 20 minutes generating custom mood boards.

## Tools of the Trade

### Midjourney / DALL-E
Best for: Mood boarding, style exploration, and concept art.
**Prompt Tip**: Use "style references" (--sref) in Midjourney to maintain consistency across images.

### Relume
Best for: Site architecture and wireframing.
**Workflow**:
1.  Paste your sitemap or brief into Relume.
2.  Generate a full wireframe library.
3.  Export to Figma.

### Figma AI Plugins
-   **Magician**: For generating icons and copy.
-   **Automator**: For batch renaming and layer organisation.
-   **Attention Insight**: For predicting where users will look (heatmaps).

## Practical Exercise: The Speed Run

### Task
You have 30 minutes to design a landing page for a "Luxury Pet Hotel".

1.  **Mood Board**: Generate 4 images in Midjourney that define the colour palette and vibe.
2.  **Wireframe**: Use Relume (or a similar tool) to generate the layout structure.
3.  **Content**: Use ChatGPT to write the headlines and body copy.
4.  **Assembly**: Bring it all into Figma.

### Questions to Consider
-   Did the AI struggle with specific UI elements (e.g., buttons)?
-   How much time did you save on "lorem ipsum" placement?
-   Is the design generic, or did you manage to inject personality?

## Next Steps

You have the layout. Now you need the assets.
