# AI-Driven UI/UX Workflow

This module is about using AI to handle the tedious parts of design work—so you can spend more time on the creative problem-solving that actually matters.

AI won't replace designers. But it will replace the hours you spend scrolling Pinterest for inspiration or writing placeholder text for the hundredth time.

## What You'll Learn

- Create mood boards in minutes instead of days
- Generate wireframes and sitemaps automatically
- Populate designs with realistic content (no more Lorem Ipsum)
- Create responsive layout variations quickly
- Use AI plugins in Figma to speed up repetitive tasks

## What's Actually Changed

### What AI Handles: The Tedious Work

**Before:**
- 2 days scrolling Pinterest for inspiration
- Manually creating wireframes from scratch
- Writing placeholder text everywhere
- Creating multiple layout variations by hand

**Now:**
- Custom mood boards in 20 minutes
- AI-generated wireframe structures
- Realistic content generated instantly
- Multiple variations with a few clicks

### What AI Can't Handle: Your Judgement

You still need to:
- Make design decisions (colours, spacing, typography)
- Understand user needs and client requirements
- Create cohesive brand experiences
- Think strategically about user flows

AI is a tool, not a colleague. It handles grunt work so you can focus on the interesting problems.

## The Toolkit

### Midjourney / DALL-E (Image Generation)

Generate images from text descriptions.

**Best for:**
- Mood boarding (custom inspiration images)
- Style exploration (try different visual directions)
- Concept art (visualise ideas before building)

**Pro tip:** In Midjourney, use style references (`--sref`) to keep images consistent.

**Example prompt:**
> "Modern minimalist website design, soft pastel colours, clean typography, luxury feel, --style raw"

### Relume (Wireframing & Sitemaps)

Generates wireframes and sitemaps from descriptions.

**How it works:**
1. Paste your project brief into Relume
2. It generates a wireframe library
3. Export to Figma
4. You refine and add your design

Think of it as a starting point that saves hours of layout work.

### Figma AI Plugins

**Magician** — Generates icons, copy, and content. Saves hours of searching.

**Automator** — Batch operations like renaming and organising layers. Handles tedious file cleanup.

**Attention Insight** — Predicts where users will look. Useful for validating layouts before user testing.

## Practical Exercise: 30-Minute Landing Page

Let's design a landing page for a "Luxury Pet Hotel" using AI tools. This is about speed and learning, not perfection.

### Step 1: Mood Board (5 minutes)

Generate 4 images in Midjourney that define colour palette and vibe.

**Prompt ideas:**
- "Luxury pet hotel interior, elegant, warm lighting, premium materials"
- "Happy pets in luxury setting, professional photography style"
- "Modern pet care facility, clean, welcoming, upscale"

### Step 2: Wireframe (10 minutes)

Use Relume to generate the layout structure:
- Hero section
- Services overview
- Testimonials
- Contact form
- Footer

Get a basic structure, then refine in Figma.

### Step 3: Content (5 minutes)

Use ChatGPT to write headlines and copy:

> "Write compelling copy for a luxury pet hotel landing page. Include: a hero headline, 3 service descriptions, and a call-to-action. Make it warm but professional."

### Step 4: Assembly (10 minutes)

Bring everything into Figma:
- Import your wireframe
- Add mood board images for reference
- Use the AI-generated copy
- Apply your design skills to make it cohesive

### Reflect

After you're done, consider:
- Did AI struggle with specific UI elements?
- How much time did you save vs. doing it manually?
- Is the design generic, or did you inject personality?
- What would you do differently next time?

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Reliance on AI
Using AI for everything and losing your creative voice. Use AI for inspiration and structure, but make final decisions yourself.

### Generic Designs
AI-generated designs can look similar to other AI-generated designs. Always customise—colours, spacing, typography.

### Tool Overload
Trying to use every AI tool at once. Master one tool at a time. Start with mood boarding, then wireframes, then plugins.

## What's Next

1. **Generative Assets** — Create icons, illustrations, and graphics with AI
2. **Design Systems** — Use AI to build and maintain design systems
3. **Advanced Workflows** — Combine multiple AI tools for complex projects

## Before Moving On

- [ ] Read through the content
- [ ] Completed the 30-minute exercise (even roughly)
- [ ] Installed at least 2 AI plugins in Figma
- [ ] Created your first AI-generated mood board

This should take about 45 minutes—longer if you're doing the exercises thoroughly.
