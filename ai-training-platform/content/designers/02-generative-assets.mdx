# Generative Assets

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Create custom icon sets using vector-based AI tools
- Generate seamless textures and patterns for backgrounds
- Upscale low-resolution client assets without losing quality
- Maintain visual consistency across a library of generated assets

## Beyond Stock Photos

Stop searching Unsplash for "business handshake".
Start generating exactly what you need.

### 1. Icons and Vectors
Tools like **Recraft.ai** and **Vectorizer.ai** are game changers.
**Workflow**:
1.  Sketch a rough shape on paper (or in Figma).
2.  Upload to Recraft.
3.  Prompt: "Minimalist line icon, rounded corners, blue gradient."
4.  Export as SVG.

### 2. Textures and Patterns
Need a subtle background for a SaaS dashboard?
**Midjourney Prompt**:
> "Seamless pattern, isometric data flow, subtle grey on white, minimal, vector style --tile"

The `--tile` parameter ensures it loops perfectly.

### 3. Upscaling
Client sends you a 20kb logo from 1998?
Don't rebuild it.
Use **Magnific AI** or **Topaz Gigapixel** to hallucinate the missing details.
*Warning*: Always check the text. AI loves to misspell brand names during upscaling.

## Practical Exercise: The Asset Library

### Task
Create a cohesive asset pack for a fictional "Organic Juice Brand".

1.  **Logo**: Generate a vector logo (Fruit + Geometry).
2.  **Pattern**: Generate a seamless fruit pattern for the packaging.
3.  **Photography**: Generate 3 product shots of the bottle on a wooden table.

### Questions to Consider
-   How hard was it to get the "fruit" looking the same in the logo and the pattern?
-   Did the upscaler ruin any fine details?
-   Could you sell this asset pack?

## Next Steps

You have the assets. Now let's organise them.
Next up: **Design Systems & AI**.
