# Design Systems & AI

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Automate the documentation of your design system
- Generate design tokens (JSON) from Figma styles
- Use AI to check your designs for accessibility (WCAG) compliance
- Create a "Chat with your Design System" bot for developers

## The Documentation Nightmare

Nobody likes writing documentation.
AI loves it.

### 1. Writing Component Docs
Select a component in Figma (e.g., a Primary Button).
Take a screenshot.
Paste into ChatGPT.
**Prompt**:
> "Write documentation for this button component. Include:
> - Usage guidelines (When to use vs Secondary)
> - States (Hover, Active, Disabled)
> - Accessibility requirements
> - Format as Markdown."

### 2. Accessibility Checks
Don't wait for the audit.
Use plugins like **Stark** (AI features) or simply export your screen and ask GPT-4 Vision:
> "Analyse this UI for accessibility issues. Focus on colour contrast, font size, and touch target size. List the top 3 violations of WCAG 2.1 AA."

### 3. Naming Things
The hardest problem in computer science (and design).
Let AI suggest semantic names for your tokens.
> "I have a colour #0055FF. It is used for primary actions. Suggest a semantic name that follows the 'Category-Property-Value' structure."
> *AI Suggestion*: `color-action-primary-default`

## Practical Exercise: The System Audit

### Task
Take an old project file.
1.  **Audit**: Run an AI accessibility check on the home screen.
2.  **Doc**: Generate documentation for the "Card" component.
3.  **Tokenise**: Ask AI to generate a JSON structure for your colour palette.

### Questions to Consider
-   Did the AI catch contrast issues you missed?
-   Is the generated documentation actually useful for a developer?
-   How much time did this save compared to manual writing?

## Next Steps

You've completed the Designer Track!
You now have the tools to:
1.  Speed up your workflow.
2.  Generate custom assets.
3.  Maintain a robust system.
