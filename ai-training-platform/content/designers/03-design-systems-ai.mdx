# Design Systems & AI

Welcome to the final designer module! This one is about something every designer needs but nobody likes doing: **design system documentation and maintenance**.

**Here's the truth:** Design systems are powerful, but documenting them is tedious. AI can write most of the documentation for you, check accessibility, and even help name your design tokens.

**This module will teach you:** How to use AI to maintain a robust, well-documented design system without spending days writing docs.

*'Design System: Powerful, organised, consistent. Documentation: Tedious, time-consuming, always outdated. AI: I can help with that!'*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Automate the documentation of your design system components
- Generate design tokens (JSON) from Figma styles
- Use AI to check designs for accessibility compliance
- Create a 'chat with your design system' experience for developers
- Maintain your design system efficiently

## The Documentation Nightmare (And How AI Solves It)

Let's be honest about design system documentation.

### The Problem

**Traditional documentation:**
- Takes hours to write
- Gets outdated quickly
- Nobody reads it anyway
- Boring to create
- Hard to keep updated

**The reality:**
- You need documentation
- But you don't have time
- So it doesn't get done
- Then nobody knows how to use your components

### The Solution

AI can write most of the documentation for you. You review and refine it. Much faster!

**Think of it like this:** You focus on designing great components. AI handles the tedious documentation writing.

![Documentation Nightmare](https://media.giphy.com/media/26xBwdIuRCiYhmeGk/giphy.gif)
*'Documentation: The thing everyone needs but nobody wants to write. AI: I'll write it, you just review it. You: Deal!'*

## Technique 1: Writing Component Documentation (Automated)

Don't write component docs manually. Let AI do it!

### The Workflow

**Step 1:** Select a component in Figma (e.g., a Primary Button)

**Step 2:** Take a screenshot of the component in all its states
- Default state
- Hover state
- Active/pressed state
- Disabled state
- Any error states

**Step 3:** Paste into ChatGPT or your AI tool

**Step 4:** Ask AI:
> "Write documentation for this button component. Include:
> - Usage guidelines (When to use vs Secondary button)
> - All states (Hover, Active, Disabled, Error)
> - Accessibility requirements (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
> - Code examples for developers
> - Format as Markdown."

**Step 5:** Review and refine
- Is it accurate?
- Does it cover everything?
- Add any missing information
- Add real code examples from your actual implementation

**What this saves:** Hours of writing, and the docs are based on actual components!

![Component Docs](https://media.giphy.com/media/26xBwdIuRCiYhmeGk/giphy.gif)
*'Component: *exists* AI: I'll document that for you. Documentation: *appears* You: That was fast. Also you: And it's actually useful!'*

### Example: Button Component Documentation

**AI-generated documentation:**
```markdown
# Primary Button

## Usage
Use the Primary Button for the main action on a page or in a form. 
Use Secondary Button for less important actions.

## States

### Default
- Background: Blue (#0055FF)
- Text: White
- Border: None

### Hover
- Background: Darker blue (#0044CC)
- Cursor: Pointer

### Active/Pressed
- Background: Even darker blue (#0033AA)
- Slight shadow

### Disabled
- Background: Grey (#CCCCCC)
- Text: Light grey
- Cursor: Not allowed

## Accessibility
- Keyboard navigable (Tab key)
- Screen reader: "Button, [button text]"
- Minimum touch target: 44x44px
- Focus state: Blue outline

## Code Example
```jsx
<Button variant="primary" onClick={handleClick}>
  Submit
</Button>
```
```

**See?** Complete documentation generated in seconds!

## Technique 2: Accessibility Checks (Before the Audit)

Don't wait for an accessibility audit to find issues. Check them yourself with AI!

### Why Accessibility Matters

**The reality:**
- Many users have disabilities
- Accessibility is often an afterthought
- Fixing issues late is expensive
- It's the right thing to do

**Common issues:**
- Poor colour contrast (text hard to read)
- Text too small
- Touch targets too small
- Missing keyboard navigation
- No screen reader support

### How to Check with AI

**Method 1: Using AI Vision**

**Step 1:** Export a screenshot of your design

**Step 2:** Ask AI:
> "Analyse this UI for accessibility issues. Focus on:
> - Colour contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA standards)
> - Font size (minimum 16px for body text)
> - Touch target size (minimum 44x44px)
> - Visual hierarchy
> List the top 3 violations and suggest fixes."

**Step 3:** Fix the issues AI found

**Method 2: Using Plugins**

**Stark** (Figma plugin) has AI features that can:
- Check colour contrast automatically
- Suggest accessible colour alternatives
- Analyse your entire design system

**How to use:**
1. Install Stark in Figma
2. Select elements you want to check
3. Run accessibility analysis
4. Review suggestions
5. Fix issues

![Accessibility](https://media.giphy.com/media/26xBwdIuRCiYhmeGk/giphy.gif)
*'Accessibility: Important but easy to forget. AI: I'll check that for you. You: *fixes issues before launch* Your users: Thank you!'*

### Example: AI Accessibility Report

**Your design:** A login form with light grey text on white background

**AI analysis:**
> "⚠️ Accessibility Issues Found:
> 
> 1. **Colour Contrast**: Text colour (#CCCCCC) on white background has contrast ratio of 1.2:1. WCAG AA requires 4.5:1 for normal text. 
>    - Fix: Use darker grey (#666666) or black (#000000)
> 
> 2. **Touch Target Size**: Submit button is 32x32px. Minimum should be 44x44px for mobile.
>    - Fix: Increase button size to at least 44x44px
> 
> 3. **Focus State**: No visible focus indicator for keyboard navigation.
>    - Fix: Add a 2px blue outline on focus"

**AI found real issues and suggested fixes!**

## Technique 3: Naming Design Tokens (The Hardest Problem)

Naming things is famously the hardest problem in computer science. AI can help!

### What Are Design Tokens?

**Design tokens** = The values that define your design system (colours, spacing, typography, etc.)

**Example:**
- Primary colour: `#0055FF`
- Large spacing: `32px`
- Heading font: `Funnel Display, Bold`

### The Naming Challenge

**Bad names:**
- `blue` (too vague)
- `color1` (not descriptive)
- `bigSpacing` (subjective)

**Good names:**
- `color-action-primary-default` (clear, semantic)
- `spacing-large` (descriptive, consistent)
- `typography-heading-large` (organised, understandable)

### How AI Helps

**Step 1:** Show AI your colour/value

**Step 2:** Ask AI:
> "I have a colour #0055FF. It is used for primary actions (buttons, links). Suggest a semantic name that follows the 'Category-Property-Value' structure."

**AI suggestion:**
> `color-action-primary-default`
> 
> Structure:
> - `color` = category (it's a colour)
> - `action` = property (used for actions)
> - `primary` = value type (primary action)
> - `default` = state (default state)

**Step 3:** Use this naming pattern for all your tokens!

### Creating a Token Structure

**Ask AI:**
> "Generate a JSON structure for design tokens. Include:
> - Colours (primary, secondary, neutral, semantic)
> - Spacing (small, medium, large, xl)
> - Typography (headings, body, captions)
> - Use the naming pattern: category-property-value"

**What you get:** A complete, organised token structure ready to use!

![Design Tokens](https://media.giphy.com/media/26xBwdIuRCiYhmeGk/giphy.gif)
*'Design Tokens: The foundation of your design system. Naming them: The hardest part. AI: I'll suggest semantic names that make sense!'*

## Your Practice Exercise: The System Audit

Ready to audit and document a design system? Let's do it!

### Step 1: Accessibility Audit (15 minutes)

**Task:** Run an AI accessibility check on a design.

**What to do:**
1. Export a screenshot of a page/component
2. Ask AI to analyse it for accessibility issues
3. List the top 3 issues
4. Fix them in your design
5. Re-check to confirm fixes

**Questions to consider:**
- Did AI catch issues you missed?
- Were the suggestions helpful?
- How easy were they to fix?

### Step 2: Component Documentation (15 minutes)

**Task:** Generate documentation for a component.

**What to do:**
1. Choose a component (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
2. Take screenshots of all states
3. Ask AI to write documentation
4. Review and refine it
5. Add it to your design system

**Questions to consider:**
- Is the documentation actually useful for developers?
- Does it cover all the important information?
- Would a new team member understand how to use it?

### Step 3: Tokenise Your System (15 minutes)

**Task:** Generate a JSON structure for your design tokens.

**What to do:**
1. List your main colours, spacing, and typography
2. Ask AI to generate a JSON structure
3. Use the suggested naming pattern
4. Review and adjust
5. Export for developers

**Questions to consider:**
- Are the names clear and semantic?
- Is the structure logical?
- Would developers understand this?

### Step 4: Create a "Chat with Design System" Bot (Optional, Advanced)

**Task:** Set up a way for developers to ask questions about your design system.

**How it works:**
1. Feed your design system documentation into an AI
2. Developers can ask: "What colour should I use for error states?"
3. AI answers based on your actual design system
4. Saves time answering the same questions!

**This is advanced**, but it's a powerful way to make your design system more accessible to your team.

![System Audit](https://media.giphy.com/media/26xBwdIuRCiYhmeGk/giphy.gif)
*'Design System: Complete, documented, accessible. Time: 50 minutes with AI. Without AI: Would take days. You: I'm never going back!'*

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Not Reviewing AI-Generated Docs

**The problem:** Assuming AI documentation is perfect

**The solution:** Always review and refine. AI is helpful, but you're responsible for accuracy.

### Mistake #2: Inconsistent Token Naming

**The problem:** Mixing naming patterns (some tokens use one pattern, others use different)

**The solution:** Define your naming pattern once, then use it consistently. AI can help generate names that follow your pattern.

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Accessibility

**The problem:** Thinking accessibility is someone else's job

**The solution:** Check accessibility as you design. AI makes it easy—no excuses!

### Mistake #4: Documentation That's Too Technical

**The problem:** Writing docs that only developers understand

**The solution:** Ask AI to rewrite for your audience. "Rewrite this for project managers" or "Make this beginner-friendly."

![Common Mistakes](https://media.giphy.com/media/26xBwdIuRCiYhmeGk/giphy.gif)
*'Mistake: Perfect documentation that nobody can understand. Solution: AI, make this beginner-friendly! AI: Done!'*
