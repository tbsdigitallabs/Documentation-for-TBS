# Foundation: Understanding AI for Developers

Welcome! This module will give you a clear, practical understanding of AI tools and how to use them safely in your development work.

---

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you'll understand:

- What AI actually is (in plain English)
- How AI differs from traditional programming
- What's safe to share with AI tools (and what isn't)
- Where AI helps most in development
- Where AI falls short (and why you're still essential)

---

## What is AI? (The Simple Answer)

**Artificial Intelligence** is software that can handle tasks that normally require human thinking—like understanding language, recognising patterns, or making decisions.

**The key difference:**

- **Traditional code**: You write explicit rules. The computer follows them exactly.
- **AI**: The system learns patterns from examples. It can handle situations it wasn't explicitly programmed for.

**Think of it like this:**

Traditional code is like giving someone a recipe: "Add 2 cups of flour, then 1 cup of sugar."

AI is like showing someone 1,000 cakes and saying "learn to make cakes." They figure out the patterns themselves.

---

## AI in Your Daily Work

Here's what AI coding tools can actually do for you:

- **Write code** from natural language descriptions
- **Explain code** you didn't write
- **Find bugs** before you run the code
- **Write documentation** from your codebase
- **Generate test cases** for functions
- **Refactor code** to be cleaner or more efficient

**Important:** AI doesn't replace you. It's a tool that handles repetitive work so you can focus on solving interesting problems.

---

## AI, Machine Learning, and LLMs: What's the Difference?

These terms get thrown around, but they mean different things:

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The big umbrella term. Any system that can do tasks requiring intelligence.

**Examples you've used:**
- Siri or Alexa
- Spam filters
- Autocomplete in your phone

### Machine Learning (ML)

A way to build AI. Instead of programming rules, you show the system examples and it learns patterns.

**Examples:**
- Netflix recommendations
- Fraud detection
- Email categorisation

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

The type of AI most relevant to developers. These are trained on massive amounts of text (including code) and can understand and generate human-like text.

**Examples:**
- ChatGPT
- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor
- Claude

**Why this matters for developers:** LLMs understand both natural language and programming languages, so you can describe what you want and get code back.

---

## Security: The Rules You Must Follow

Before using AI tools, you need to understand security. This is non-negotiable.

### Rule 1: Never Share Secrets

AI tools process everything you send them. Some providers use this data to improve their models. **Treat the input field like a public forum.**

**Never share:**
- API keys, passwords, or tokens
- Client data or personal information
- Proprietary business logic
- Database credentials
- Private keys or certificates

**Safe to share:**
- Public code patterns
- Generic examples
- Error messages (scrubbed of sensitive context)
- General programming questions

**Remember:** If you wouldn't post it on a public forum, don't share it with AI.

---

## Security: Review Everything

AI-generated code often works, but it's not always correct, secure, or efficient.

**Treat AI code like code from a junior developer:** Review it properly before using it.

**Always check for:**
- Security vulnerabilities (especially in authentication, input handling, and database queries)
- Compliance with your team's coding standards
- Edge cases the AI might have missed
- Whether you actually understand what the code does

**The rule:** If you can't explain it, don't use it.

---

## Security: Be Transparent

There's nothing wrong with using AI to write code. But be honest about it with your team.

**Why transparency matters:**
- Helps with code review
- Builds trust
- Allows proper security checks
- Helps the team learn together

**Best practice:** Mention when AI helped, especially for complex or security-sensitive code.

---

## Where AI Helps Most

AI excels at repetitive, mechanical tasks:

**What AI does well:**
- Boilerplate code you've written many times
- CRUD operations and similar patterns
- Documentation from existing code
- Catching common bugs and typos
- Explaining unfamiliar codebases
- Generating test cases

**Think of it as:** Handling the grunt work so you can focus on the interesting problems.

---

## Where AI Falls Short

AI struggles with tasks that require judgement, context, or domain knowledge:

**What AI can't do well:**
- Understand your specific business rules
- Make architectural decisions (microservices vs monolith, database choices)
- Handle edge cases that require deep context
- Understand security implications in complex systems
- Know why a client wants something done a certain way
- Make ethical or strategic decisions

**The bottom line:** AI is a tool, not a replacement for thinking. You're still the developer. AI just handles more of the repetitive work.

---

## A Practical Example

Let's look at a simple function:

```javascript
function calculateTotal(items) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    total += items[i].price;
  }
  return total;
}
```

**Before asking AI for help, think through it yourself:**

What happens if:
- Someone passes `null` or `undefined`?
- An item doesn't have a `price` property?
- The `price` is a string instead of a number?
- The array is empty?

**This is the kind of analysis you should always do**—before and after AI generates code. The AI can help you improve this function, but you need to know what questions to ask and how to evaluate the response.

---

## What's Next

This foundation gives you the basics. The next modules cover:

- **Module 2:** Setting up and using Cursor, Copilot, and other AI tools
- **Module 3:** Real workflows—writing, debugging, and refactoring with AI
- **Module 4:** Advanced techniques and team integration
- **Module 5:** A complete project using AI throughout

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI learns patterns from data**—it's different from traditional rule-based code
2. **Never share secrets**—treat AI inputs like public forums
3. **Always review AI code**—it's helpful but not perfect
4. **AI handles repetitive work**—you handle the thinking
5. **Be transparent**—tell your team when you use AI
