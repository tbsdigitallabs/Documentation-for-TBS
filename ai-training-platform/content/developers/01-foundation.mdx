# Foundation Module: Understanding AI for Developers

If you're new to AI-assisted development, this is where we start. By the end, you'll understand what these tools actually do, what's safe to share with them, and where they fit into your daily work.

## What You'll Walk Away With

- A clear understanding of what AI, ML, and LLMs actually are
- Knowledge of what's safe to share with AI tools (and what isn't)
- A sense of where AI genuinely helps versus where it falls short
- Confidence to start using these tools in your workflow

## What is AI? (The Practical Version)

**Artificial Intelligence** is software that can handle tasks that typically require human reasoning—understanding language, recognising patterns, or making decisions based on incomplete information.

The key difference from traditional code: regular software follows explicit rules you write. AI systems learn patterns from data and can handle situations they weren't explicitly programmed for.

### What This Means for You

Here's what AI can actually do in your day-to-day work:

- **Generate code** from natural language descriptions
- **Spot bugs** before you run the code
- **Write documentation** based on your codebase
- **Generate test cases** for functions and modules
- **Explain errors** and suggest fixes

## AI, ML, and LLMs: What's the Difference?

These terms get used interchangeably, but they mean different things. Understanding the distinction helps you pick the right tool for the job.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The umbrella term. Any system that can perform tasks requiring intelligence—whether through explicit rules or learned behaviour.

**Examples you've used:** Siri, Alexa, spam filters, autocomplete

### Machine Learning (ML)

A subset of AI where systems improve through exposure to data rather than explicit programming. You show it examples, and it learns patterns.

**Examples:** Netflix recommendations, fraud detection, email categorisation

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

The category most relevant to your work. These are ML systems trained on massive text datasets—including code—that can understand and generate human-like text.

**Examples:** ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude

LLMs are particularly useful for developers because they understand both natural language and programming languages, so you can describe what you want and get code back.

## Security: The Non-Negotiable Rules

Before we go further, let's cover what you absolutely must know about using these tools safely.

### Rule 1: Never Share Secrets

AI tools process everything you give them. Some providers use this data for training. Treat the input field like a public forum.

**Never share:**
- API keys, passwords, or tokens
- Client data or PII
- Proprietary business logic or trade secrets
- Database credentials
- Private keys or certificates

**Safe to share:**
- Public code patterns
- Generic examples
- Error messages (scrubbed of sensitive context)
- General programming questions

### Rule 2: Review Everything

AI-generated code often works but isn't always correct, secure, or efficient. Treat it like code from a junior developer—review it properly before merging.

Check for:
- Security vulnerabilities (especially in auth, input handling, and database queries)
- Compliance with your team's coding standards
- Edge cases the AI might have missed
- Understanding of what the code actually does

### Rule 3: Be Transparent

There's nothing wrong with using AI to write code. But be honest about it with your team. It helps with code review and builds trust.

## Where AI Helps (And Where It Doesn't)

Being realistic about capabilities saves frustration.

### What AI Does Well

**Repetitive tasks:**
- Boilerplate code you've written a hundred times
- CRUD operations and similar patterns
- Documentation from existing code
- Catching common bugs and typos
- Explaining unfamiliar codebases

Think of it as handling the mechanical work so you can focus on the interesting problems.

### What AI Struggles With

**Judgement calls:**
- Your specific business rules and domain logic
- Architectural decisions (microservices vs monolith, database choices)
- Edge cases that require understanding context
- Security considerations in complex systems
- Understanding why a client wants something done a certain way

AI is a tool, not a replacement for thinking. You're still the developer. AI just handles more of the grunt work.

## Practical Exercise: Analysing Code

Let's put this into practice. Here's a simple function:

```javascript
function calculateTotal(items) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    total += items[i].price;
  }
  return total;
}
```

Before asking AI for help, think through it yourself:

**What happens if:**
- Someone passes `null` or `undefined`?
- An item doesn't have a `price` property?
- The `price` is a string instead of a number?
- The array is empty?

![Works on my machine](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGcguWZHRC2HyBRS/giphy.gif)

This is the kind of analysis you should always do before—and after—AI generates code. The AI can help you improve this function, but you need to know what questions to ask and how to evaluate the response.

In the next module, we'll use AI tools to actually improve this code and see the workflow in action.

## What's Next

This was the foundation. The next modules cover:

- **Module 2:** Setting up and using Cursor, Copilot, and other AI tools
- **Module 3:** Real workflows—writing, debugging, and refactoring with AI
- **Module 4:** Advanced techniques and team integration
- **Module 5:** A complete project using AI throughout

## Resources

- [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs)
- [GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)
- [Cursor IDE Features](https://cursor.sh/docs)
- [AI Ethics Guidelines](https://www.partnershiponai.org/)

## Before Moving On

Make sure you've:

- [ ] Read through the content (especially the security section)
- [ ] Understood the difference between AI, ML, and LLMs
- [ ] Thought through the code analysis exercise
- [ ] Bookmarked the resources for reference

This should take about 30 minutes. If you want to take notes or really dig into the exercise, allow more time.
