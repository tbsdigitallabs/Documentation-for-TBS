# Foundation Module: Understanding AI for Developers

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of AI and how it applies to software development
- Differentiate between AI, machine learning, and large language models
- Recognise ethical considerations and limitations when using AI in development
- Identify opportunities for AI integration in your daily workflow

## What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. In software development, AI can assist with:

- **Code Generation**: Writing code based on natural language descriptions
- **Code Review**: Analysing code for bugs, security issues, and best practices
- **Documentation**: Generating and maintaining technical documentation
- **Testing**: Creating test cases and identifying edge cases
- **Debugging**: Analysing error logs and suggesting fixes

## AI vs Machine Learning vs Large Language Models

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- **Definition**: The broad field of creating intelligent machines
- **Scope**: Includes rule-based systems, expert systems, and machine learning
- **Example**: A chatbot that follows predefined rules

### Machine Learning (ML)
- **Definition**: A subset of AI that learns patterns from data
- **Scope**: Includes supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning
- **Example**: A system that predicts code quality based on historical data

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Definition**: AI models trained on vast amounts of text data
- **Scope**: Can understand and generate human-like text
- **Example**: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Cursor AI

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy and Security
- **Code Security**: Never share sensitive API keys or credentials with AI tools
- **Client Data**: Ensure client information remains confidential
- **Company Secrets**: Don't expose proprietary algorithms or business logic

### Intellectual Property
- **Code Ownership**: Understand who owns AI-generated code
- **Attribution**: Give proper credit when using AI assistance
- **Licensing**: Ensure AI-generated code complies with project licenses

### Bias and Fairness
- **Algorithmic Bias**: AI models may reflect biases in training data
- **Inclusive Design**: Consider diverse user needs when implementing AI features
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test AI-generated code for edge cases

## Limitations of AI in Development

### What AI Can Do Well
- Generate boilerplate code
- Suggest code improvements
- Explain complex code
- Create documentation
- Identify common bugs

### What AI Struggles With
- Understanding complex business logic
- Making architectural decisions
- Handling edge cases
- Ensuring security best practices
- Maintaining code quality standards

## Practical Exercise: AI Code Analysis

### Task
Analyse the following code snippet and identify potential improvements:

```javascript
function calculateTotal(items) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    total += items[i].price;
  }
  return total;
}
```

### Questions to Consider
1. What potential issues do you see in this code?
2. How could AI help improve this function?
3. What additional considerations should be made for production code?

### Discussion Points
- Error handling
- Input validation
- Performance optimisation
- Code readability
- Testing requirements
