# Automated Research and Data Pipelines

Welcome back! Now that you understand the basics of AI, let's build something useful. This module will teach you how to create tools that automatically gather and analyse information—think of it as giving yourself a research assistant that never sleeps.

*'When you realise you can automate the boring research tasks'*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Build simple automated scrapers using AI (don't worry, we'll start simple!)
- Create data pipelines that feed information into AI for analysis
- Understand the ethical rules of web scraping (this is important!)
- Build a basic 'research engine' that runs automatically

## Why Automate Research? (The Problem We're Solving)

Let's be honest: manual research is **tedious**. 

**The old way:**
- Spend 2 hours Googling
- Copy-paste information into a document
- Try to remember where you found everything
- Do it all again next week when you need updated info

**The new way:**
- Click a button
- Get a report with all the latest information
- Have it update automatically

As developers, we can build tools that give our strategy team (and ourselves) superpowers. Instead of 'Googling for 2 hours,' we want 'Click button, get report.'

## How a Research Pipeline Works (The Simple Version)

Think of a research pipeline like a factory assembly line:

1. **Get the Data** (Ingestion): Visit websites, read APIs, check RSS feeds
2. **Clean It Up** (Processing): Remove junk, organise the information
3. **Understand It** (Analysis): Send it to AI to extract the important bits
4. **Save It** (Storage): Put it in a database or file
5. **Show It** (Presentation): Display it in a way that makes sense

**Don't worry if this sounds complex**—we'll build it step by step, and you'll understand each part before moving to the next.

## The Tools You'll Use

Before we start building, here are the tools we'll talk about:

### Puppeteer / Playwright
**What it does:** Controls a web browser automatically (like a robot using Chrome)
**Why you need it:** Some websites need JavaScript to load content—regular scraping can't see that
**Think of it as:** A robot that can click buttons and scroll pages

### LangChain / LlamaIndex
**What it does:** Helps organise how AI processes information
**Why you need it:** Makes it easier to send data to AI and get structured results back
**Think of it as:** A translator between your code and the AI

### OpenAI API / Anthropic API
**What it does:** The 'brain' that analyses the data
**Why you need it:** This is what actually understands and extracts information
**Think of it as:** The smart assistant that reads everything and tells you what matters

### Supabase / Postgres
**What it does:** Stores the data you collect
**Why you need it:** You need somewhere to save all this information
**Think of it as:** A filing cabinet for your research

**Don't worry about learning all of these right now**—we'll introduce them as we need them!

## Building Your First Simple Scraper (Step by Step)

Let's start with something simple: extracting information from a webpage.

### The Old Way (Why It's Frustrating)

Traditionally, developers would write complex code (called 'regex') to find specific patterns in HTML. This is **brittle**—if the website changes its layout even slightly, your code breaks.

**Example of the old way:**
```javascript
// This is fragile and breaks if the HTML changes
const title = html.match(/<h1>(.*?)<\/h1>/)[1];
```

### The New Way (Using AI)

Instead of trying to parse HTML with code, we let AI understand the content and extract what we need:

```typescript
// Simplified example - don't worry about understanding this yet!
const rawHtml = await page.content();
const prompt = `
  Extract all news headlines and dates from this HTML.
  Return as a JSON array: [{ headline: string, date: string }].
  HTML: ${rawHtml.substring(0, 10000)}...
`;
const result = await llm.complete(prompt);
```

**What's happening here?**
1. We get the HTML from a webpage
2. We send it to AI with instructions: 'Find headlines and dates'
3. AI understands the structure and extracts the data
4. We get back clean, structured data

**The beauty of this:** Even if the website changes its layout, AI can usually still find what you need!

*'Old way: Write 50 lines of regex. New way: Ask AI nicely.'*

## The Ethical Rules (Please Read This!)

Just because you *can* scrape a website doesn't mean you *should*. Let's talk about being a good internet citizen.

### Rule #1: Check robots.txt

**What is it?** A file on websites that tells bots what they're allowed to access.

**How to check:** Visit `website.com/robots.txt` before scraping

**Why it matters:** It's the website owner's way of saying 'please don't scrape this' or 'this part is okay'

### Rule #2: Don't Hammer Their Servers

**What this means:** Add delays between requests. Don't make 1000 requests per second.

**Why it matters:** You could crash their website or get yourself blocked (or worse, sued)

**How to do it right:** Add a 1-2 second delay between requests. Be respectful.

### Rule #3: Identify Yourself

**What this means:** Set a 'User Agent' that identifies your bot honestly

**Why it matters:** Website owners can see who's accessing their site. Be transparent.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Good: Honest about who you are
'User-Agent': 'TBS-Research-Bot/1.0 (research@tbsdigitallabs.com.au)'

// Bad: Pretending to be a regular browser
'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0...'
```

![Ethical Scraping](https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/02022B/D56EED?text=Image)
*'Be a good bot. Check robots.txt. Add delays. Identify yourself. Don't be that bot.'*

## Your First Practice: Build a News Aggregator

Ready to build something? Let's create a simple script that gathers tech news.

### What We're Building

A script that:
1. Visits a tech news website (like Hacker News)
2. Extracts the top 5 stories
3. Uses AI to summarise each story into one sentence
4. Saves everything to a JSON file

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

**If you're using Node.js:**
```bash
npm install puppeteer openai
```

**If you're using Python:**
```bash
pip install playwright openai
```

**Don't worry if you're not sure which to use**—both work! Pick the language you're more comfortable with.

### Step 2: Write the Basic Scraper

Start simple: just get the HTML from a page. Don't try to extract anything yet—just see if you can access the page.

**Hint:** Use Puppeteer (Node.js) or Playwright (Python) to open the page and get its content.

### Step 3: Extract the Headlines

Now use AI to extract the headlines. Paste the HTML into ChatGPT or use the OpenAI API with a prompt like:

> "Extract the top 5 news headlines from this HTML. Return them as a JSON array with 'headline' and 'link' fields."

### Step 4: Summarise Each Story

For each headline, ask AI to summarise it:

> "Summarise this news story in one sentence: [headline]"

### Step 5: Save to JSON

Save all the results to a JSON file. You should end up with something like:

```json
[
  {
    "headline": "New AI Tool Released",
    "link": "https://...",
    "summary": "A new AI tool that helps developers..."
  },
  ...
]
```

### Questions to Think About

As you build this, consider:
- What happens if the website is down?
- How do you handle errors gracefully?
- What if the AI doesn't understand the HTML?
- How would you make this run automatically every day?

**Don't worry if you get stuck!** This is about learning, not perfection. Try each step, and if something doesn't work, that's okay—you're learning!

*'Your first scraper: It works! Also your first scraper: Why is it getting blocked?'*

## Scaling Up: What's Next?

Once you've built your first scraper, you might wonder: 'How do I scale this to 100 websites?'

**The answer:** Build it step by step.

1. **Start with one website** (which you just did!)
2. **Make it work reliably** (handle errors, add retries)
3. **Add a second website** (reuse your code)
4. **Build a system** (database, scheduling, monitoring)

**Don't try to build everything at once.** Get one thing working perfectly, then expand.

## Next Steps

You've built your first research tool! Here's what comes next:

1. **AI-Assisted Testing**: Learn to test your code automatically
2. **Refactoring**: Clean up and improve your code
3. **Documentation**: Document your tools so others can use them

**Remember:** Every expert was once a beginner. You're building real tools that solve real problems. That's impressive! 🚀
