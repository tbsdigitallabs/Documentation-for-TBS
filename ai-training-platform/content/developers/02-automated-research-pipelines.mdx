# Automated Research and Data Pipelines

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Build automated scrapers using AI agents
- Create data pipelines that feed into LLMs for analysis
- Architect a "Research Engine" that runs 24/7
- Handle rate limits and anti-bot protections ethically

## The Problem with Manual Research

Manual research is slow, biased, and unscalable.
As developers, we can build tools that give our strategy team superpowers.
Instead of "Googling for 2 hours," we want "Click button, get report."

## Architecture of a Research Pipeline

1.  **Ingestion**: Getting the data (APIs, Scraping, RSS).
2.  **Processing**: Cleaning and chunking the text.
3.  **Analysis**: Sending chunks to an LLM for extraction.
4.  **Storage**: Saving structured data (JSON/SQL).
5.  **Presentation**: Showing it to the user.

### Tools
- **Puppeteer / Playwright**: For headless browsing.
- **LangChain / LlamaIndex**: For orchestration.
- **OpenAI API / Anthropic API**: For the "brain".
- **Supabase / Postgres**: For storage.

## Building a Simple Scraper Agent

Don't write regex for HTML parsing anymore. It's brittle.
Use an LLM to extract structured data from raw HTML.

```typescript
// Pseudo-code for LLM extraction
const rawHtml = await page.content();
const prompt = `
  Extract all news headlines and dates from this HTML.
  Return as a JSON array: [{ headline: string, date: string }].
  HTML: ${rawHtml.substring(0, 10000)}...
`;
const result = await llm.complete(prompt);
```

## Ethical Scraping

Just because you *can* scrape it, doesn't mean you *should*.
- **Respect robots.txt**: Check it first.
- **Rate Limiting**: Don't hammer their servers. Add delays.
- **User Agent**: Identify your bot honestly.

## Practical Exercise: The News Aggregator

### Task
Write a script (Python or Node.js) that:
1.  Visits a tech news site (e.g., Hacker News).
2.  Extracts the top 5 stories.
3.  Uses an LLM to summarise each story into one sentence.
4.  Saves the result to a JSON file.

### Questions to Consider
- How did you handle the token limits of the LLM?
- What happens if the website layout changes?
- How would you scale this to 100 websites?

## Next Steps

You've built the engine. Now let's look at how to integrate this into the wider business.
Next up: **MCP Server Development** (Module 3).
