# AI-Assisted Testing

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Generate unit tests for complex functions in seconds
- Create end-to-end (E2E) test scripts for Playwright/Cypress
- Generate realistic mock data for local development
- Identify edge cases that your manual tests missed

## The Testing Paradox

Everyone agrees testing is important.
Nobody has time to do it.
AI breaks this paradox by writing the boilerplate for you.

### 1. Unit Tests
Don't write `expect(add(1,1)).toBe(2)` by hand.
Highlight the function in Cursor/VS Code.
**Prompt**:
> "Generate a comprehensive test suite for this function using Jest. Include happy paths, edge cases (null/undefined inputs), and error handling."

### 2. E2E Testing
Writing selectors for Playwright is tedious.
**Workflow**:
1.  Paste the HTML of the page (or a screenshot).
2.  **Prompt**: "Write a Playwright test script that:
    - Logs in as a user
    - Navigates to the settings page
    - Updates the profile picture
    - Asserts that the success toast appears."

### 3. Mock Data
Need 100 users with Australian addresses?
**Prompt**:
> "Generate a JSON array of 50 users.
> Fields: id, firstName, lastName, email, phone (Australian format), address (Australian cities).
> Make the data look realistic, not 'Test User 1'."

## Practical Exercise: The Test Suite

### Task
Take a utility function from your current project (e.g., a date formatter or a currency converter).
1.  **Unit Test**: Generate a Jest test file with at least 5 test cases.
2.  **Edge Cases**: Ask AI "What edge cases am I missing?" and add them.
3.  **Refactor**: Ask AI to refactor the original function to make it more testable.

### Questions to Consider
-   Did the AI find a bug in your original function?
-   Are the generated tests readable?
-   How much time did this save vs writing from scratch?

## Next Steps

Your code is tested. Now let's clean it up.
Next up: **Refactoring & Legacy Code**.
