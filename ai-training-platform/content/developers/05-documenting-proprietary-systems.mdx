# Documenting Proprietary Systems

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Generate "How-to" guides for internal tools (like this one) automatically
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes using AI
- Create architectural diagrams from codebases
- Onboard new developers to your proprietary systems in half the time

## The "Bus Factor" Problem

You built a custom internal tool. It's great.
But if you get hit by a bus, nobody knows how it works.
Proprietary systems *die* without documentation.

### 1. Code-to-Docs Pipeline
Don't write the README manually.
**Workflow**:
1.  Select the core logic files.
2.  **Prompt**: "Read this code. Write a `README.md` that explains:
    - What this tool does.
    - How to install it.
    - The main architecture.
    - Common troubleshooting steps."

### 2. The "User Guide" Generator
Developers write docs for developers. Users hate them.
**Prompt**:
> "I am a Project Manager, not a coder.
> Read this technical documentation.
> Rewrite it as a 'User Guide' for me.
> Focus on *how to use it*, not *how it works*.
> Use screenshots (placeholders) and step-by-step lists."

### 3. Architectural Diagrams
Paste your folder structure or core class definitions.
**Prompt**:
> "Generate a Mermaid.js diagram that visualises the data flow of this application.
> Show how the Frontend talks to the API and the Database."

## Practical Exercise: The Legacy Tool

### Task
Choose a script or tool you wrote 6 months ago.
1.  **Diagram**: Generate a Mermaid chart of how it works.
2.  **Guide**: Generate a "Quick Start" guide for a new hire.
3.  **FAQ**: Generate 5 "Frequently Asked Questions" based on the code's complexity.

### Questions to Consider
-   Did the AI understand your code better than you remembered it?
-   Is the User Guide actually usable?
-   How easy is it to update this when the code changes?

## Next Steps

You've mastered the Developer Admin track.
Your code is clean, tested, and documented.
