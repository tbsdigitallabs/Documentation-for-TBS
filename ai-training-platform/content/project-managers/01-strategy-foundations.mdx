# Strategy Foundations

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Define the core components of a digital strategy at TBS Digital Labs
- Distinguish between strategy, tactics, and execution
- Identify where AI can accelerate strategic planning without replacing human judgement
- Structure a strategic document using TBS templates

## What is Strategy?

Strategy isn't just a to-do list. It's the "why" and "how" that guides the "what". At TBS Digital Labs, we define strategy as a coherent plan to solve a specific problem or achieve a specific goal under conditions of uncertainty.

Good strategy requires:
- **Diagnosis**: Clearly defining the challenge.
- **Guiding Policy**: The approach we'll take to deal with the challenge.
- **Coherent Action**: The coordinated steps (tactics) that carry out the guiding policy.

## The Role of AI in Strategy

AI is a force multiplier for strategy, not the strategist itself. It excels at processing information but lacks the context and intuition to make final judgement calls.

### Where AI Fits
- **Pattern Recognition**: Analysing market data to find trends.
- **Scenario Planning**: Simulating outcomes of different strategic choices.
- **Drafting**: Creating initial structures for strategic documents.

### Where Humans Must Lead
- **Goal Setting**: Defining what "success" actually looks like for the client.
- **Ethical Judgement**: Deciding if a strategy aligns with values.
- **Client Nuance**: Understanding the unwritten political or cultural constraints of a client organisation.

## Strategic Frameworks at TBS

We use a few key frameworks to keep our thinking sharp.

### 1. The Kernel (Rumelt)
Every good strategy has a kernel:
1.  **Diagnosis**: What's going on here?
2.  **Guiding Policy**: What's our approach?
3.  **Action Plans**: What are we going to do?

### 2. Jobs to be Done (JTBD)
Focus on what the user is trying to achieve, not just who they are.
- **Wrong**: "Targeting males aged 25-34."
- **Right**: "Helping busy professionals automate their morning routine."

## Practical Exercise: The Strategy Kernel

### Task
Take a current client project or a hypothetical scenario. Write a one-page "Strategy Kernel" using the three components above.

1.  **Diagnosis**: Write 2-3 sentences defining the core problem.
2.  **Guiding Policy**: Write 1-2 sentences on your chosen approach.
3.  **Action Plans**: List 3 key actions that follow this policy.

### Questions to Consider
- Does your diagnosis simplify the complexity of reality?
- Is your guiding policy actionable, or just fluff (e.g., "We will win")?
- Do your actions directly address the diagnosis?

## Next Steps

Now that you have the foundations, you're ready to move to:

1.  **AI Research**: Using tools to gather data for your diagnosis.
2.  **Internal Data**: Analysing what we already know.
3.  **Workflows**: Turning this strategy into tickets and tasks.
