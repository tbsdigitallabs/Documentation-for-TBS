# Strategy Foundations

Welcome! If you're new to strategy or just want to understand how AI fits into strategic planning, you're in the right place. This module will take you from 'strategy is just a fancy word for planning' to 'I can structure a strategic document that actually works.'

**Here's what you'll learn:** Strategy isn't just a to-do list with big words. It's a way of thinking that helps you solve problems and achieve goals—and AI can make that process faster and smarter.

*'Strategy: It's like planning, but with more thinking and less panicking.'*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Understand what strategy actually is (in plain English!)
- Tell the difference between strategy, tactics, and execution
- Know where AI helps with strategy (and where it doesn't)
- Structure a strategic document using TBS frameworks
- Write a strategy kernel that actually works

## What is Strategy? (The Simple Version)

Let's start with the basics. **Strategy** isn't just a fancy word for 'plan.' It's the 'why' and 'how' that guides the 'what.'

**Think of it like this:**
- **Tactics** = The specific things you do (post on social media, send emails)
- **Strategy** = Why you're doing those things and how they fit together
- **Execution** = Actually doing the work

At TBS Digital Labs, we define strategy as: **A coherent plan to solve a specific problem or achieve a specific goal when you're not 100% sure what will work.**

### The Three Parts of Good Strategy

Every good strategy has three essential components:

1. **Diagnosis**: What's actually going on here? What's the real problem?
2. **Guiding Policy**: What's our approach? How will we tackle this?
3. **Coherent Action**: What specific steps will we take? (These are your tactics)

**Example:**
- **Diagnosis**: "Our website isn't generating enough leads because visitors can't find what they're looking for"
- **Guiding Policy**: "We'll reorganise the site structure to match how users actually think about our services"
- **Coherent Action**: "Redesign navigation, create service landing pages, add search functionality"

*'Strategy: Diagnosis + Policy + Action. Actually understanding the problem before trying to solve it.'*

## The Role of AI in Strategy (Your New Assistant)

Here's the important part: **AI is a force multiplier for strategy, not the strategist itself.**

### What That Means

AI is amazing at:
- Processing huge amounts of information quickly
- Finding patterns in data
- Generating initial drafts and structures
- Analysing market trends

But AI struggles with:
- Understanding your specific client's unique situation
- Making judgement calls about what 'success' really means
- Knowing the unwritten rules and politics in an organisation
- Deciding if a strategy aligns with values and ethics

**Think of AI as your research assistant**—it gathers information and creates drafts, but you make the final decisions.


### Where AI Fits in Your Workflow

**Pattern Recognition**
- AI can analyse market data and find trends you might miss
- **Example:** "AI, analyse the last 6 months of competitor activity and identify patterns"

**Scenario Planning**
- AI can simulate outcomes of different strategic choices
- **Example:** "If we focus on social media vs. email marketing, what are the likely outcomes?"

**Drafting**
- AI can create initial structures for strategic documents
- **Example:** "Create a strategy document outline for a website redesign project"

### Where You Must Lead

**Goal Setting**
- You define what 'success' actually looks like for your specific client
- AI doesn't know your client's unique situation

**Ethical Judgement**
- You decide if a strategy aligns with values and ethics
- AI can suggest strategies, but you judge if they're right

**Client Nuance**
- You understand the unwritten political or cultural constraints
- AI doesn't know that 'the CEO's brother-in-law designed the old site' situation

## Strategic Frameworks at TBS (Your New Tools)

We use specific frameworks to keep our strategic thinking sharp. Don't worry—these aren't complicated. They're just ways of organising your thoughts.

### Framework #1: The Strategy Kernel (Rumelt)

This is our go-to framework. Every good strategy has a 'kernel' with three parts:

1. **Diagnosis**: What's going on here? (The problem, clearly defined)
2. **Guiding Policy**: What's our approach? (How we'll tackle it)
3. **Action Plans**: What are we going to do? (The specific steps)

**Why it works:** It forces you to understand the problem before jumping to solutions.

**Example:**
- **Diagnosis**: "Our client's website looks outdated, and competitors are winning customers with modern designs"
- **Guiding Policy**: "We'll modernise the design while keeping what works, focusing on user experience improvements"
- **Action Plans**: 
  - Conduct user research to identify pain points
  - Redesign key pages (home, services, contact)
  - Implement new navigation structure
  - Launch with A/B testing


### Framework #2: Jobs to be Done (JTBD)

This framework focuses on **what the user is trying to achieve**, not just who they are.

**Wrong approach:**
- "Targeting males aged 25-34 who live in Sydney"

**Right approach:**
- "Helping busy professionals automate their morning routine so they can focus on important work"

**Why it matters:** Demographics tell you who, but Jobs to be Done tells you *why* they need your solution.

**Example:**
Instead of "targeting small business owners," think "helping people who are overwhelmed by admin tasks automate their bookkeeping so they can focus on growing their business."

## Your First Practice: Write a Strategy Kernel

Ready to put this into practice? Let's write your first strategy kernel.

### The Task

Take a current client project (or make up a hypothetical scenario). Write a one-page 'Strategy Kernel' using the three components.

### Step 1: Diagnosis (2-3 sentences)

**What to do:** Clearly define the core problem.

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- What's the real issue here?
- What's working? What's not?
- What would success look like?

**Example:**
> "Our client's e-commerce site has high traffic but low conversions. Users add items to cart but abandon before checkout. Research shows the checkout process is confusing and takes too long."

### Step 2: Guiding Policy (1-2 sentences)

**What to do:** Define your approach to solving the problem.

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- How will we tackle this?
- What's our overall direction?
- What principles will guide our decisions?

**Example:**
> "We'll simplify the checkout process by reducing steps, adding clear progress indicators, and removing unnecessary fields. We'll prioritise user trust and clarity over collecting extra data."

### Step 3: Action Plans (3 key actions)

**What to do:** List specific steps that follow your policy.

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- What are the concrete things we'll do?
- Do these actions directly address the diagnosis?
- Are they achievable?

**Example:**
1. Redesign checkout to single-page with progress bar
2. Add trust signals (security badges, customer reviews)
3. Implement A/B testing to measure improvements

### Questions to Check Your Work

After you've written your kernel, ask:
- Does your diagnosis simplify the complexity? (It should be clear, not vague)
- Is your guiding policy actionable? (Not just 'we will win'—be specific)
- Do your actions directly address the diagnosis? (They should!)

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Confusing Tactics with Strategy

**The problem:** Listing things to do without understanding why

**The solution:** Always start with diagnosis. Understand the problem first.

### Mistake #2: Vague Guiding Policies

**The problem:** Policies like 'we will win' or 'we will be the best'

**The solution:** Be specific. 'We will focus on user experience improvements' is better than 'we will be better.'

### Mistake #3: Actions That Don't Match

**The problem:** Actions that don't address the diagnosis

**The solution:** For each action, ask: 'Does this solve the problem I identified?'

## Next Steps

You've learned the foundations! Here's what comes next:

1. **AI Research**: Learn to use AI tools to gather data for your diagnosis
2. **Internal Data**: Analyse what you already know about clients and projects
3. **Workflows**: Turn your strategy into actionable tickets and tasks

**Remember:** Strategy is a skill that improves with practice. Your first strategy kernel might feel rough—that's normal! Keep practising, and you'll get better.
