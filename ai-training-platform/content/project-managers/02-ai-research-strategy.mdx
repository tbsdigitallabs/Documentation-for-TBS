# Using AI for Research and Strategic Thinking

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Use AI tools to gather and synthesise market research 10x faster
- Construct prompts that force AI to challenge your assumptions
- Identify "hallucinations" in strategic data
- Create a "Research Sandbox" for rapid hypothesis testing

## The Research Revolution

Traditional research involves hours of Googling, reading PDFs, and manually collating notes. AI changes this workflow from "Gather -> Read -> Synthesise" to "Direct -> Verify -> Refine".

### The New Workflow
1.  **Broad Sweep**: Use AI to scan the landscape (e.g., "What are the top 5 trends in FinTech in Australia for 2025?").
2.  **Deep Dive**: Drill down into specific areas (e.g., "Explain the regulatory changes affecting Buy Now Pay Later").
3.  **Synthesis**: Ask AI to connect the dots (e.g., "How do these regulatory changes impact the trends you identified?").

## Tools of the Trade

### Perplexity AI
Best for: Real-time web search and citation.
- **Tip**: Always check the sources. Perplexity is good, but it can misinterpret a paywalled article.

### ChatGPT / Claude
Best for: Synthesis and reasoning.
- **Tip**: Paste in raw data (PDFs, CSVs) and ask it to find patterns. Don't just ask it to "guess" market data.

### NotebookLM
Best for: Deep reading of your own documents.
- **Tip**: Upload all your client briefs and previous strategy docs to create a "Client Brain".

## Prompt Engineering for Strategy

Don't ask: "Give me a strategy for a coffee shop."
Ask: "Act as a senior strategist. I am opening a high-end coffee shop in Melbourne CBD. The market is saturated. Critique my assumption that 'better beans' is a sufficient differentiator. Offer 3 alternative differentiation strategies based on current consumer behaviour."

### The "Devil's Advocate" Prompt
One of the best uses of AI is to kill your bad ideas before a client does.
> "Here is my strategic hypothesis: [Insert Idea]. Act as a skeptical investor. Tear this apart. Find the logical gaps, the missing data, and the operational risks."

## Practical Exercise: The Research Sprint

### Task
Choose a topic you know nothing about (e.g., "The future of hydroponic farming in urban areas").
Spend 15 minutes using AI tools to produce a 1-page "State of the Nation" report.

Include:
1.  **Market Size**: Rough estimates with sources.
2.  **Key Players**: Who is winning and why?
3.  **Major Headwinds**: What is stopping growth?

### Questions to Consider
- How much time did you save compared to manual searching?
- Did you catch any AI errors or outdated info?
- How did you verify the data?

## Next Steps

Research is useless without data to back it up. Next, we look at:
1.  **Internal Data**: Mining our own archives.
2.  **Data Pipelines**: Automating the flow of information.
