# Using AI to Analyse Internal Data Sources

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Securely upload and query internal datasets using AI
- Extract insights from unstructured data (emails, meeting notes, PDFs)
- Clean and format messy CSVs for analysis
- Understand the privacy boundaries when using client data

## The Hidden Goldmine

Most organisations sit on a mountain of data they never use.
- **Sales Logs**: Who bought what and when?
- **Customer Support Tickets**: What are people complaining about?
- **Meeting Transcripts**: What did we actually agree to?

AI allows us to "chat" with this data without needing to be a SQL expert.

## Security First

Before you upload anything:
1.  **Anonymise**: Remove PII (Names, Emails, Phone Numbers) unless the tool is enterprise-grade and approved (e.g., TBS Enterprise ChatGPT).
2.  **Check Policy**: Does the client NDA allow third-party processing?
3.  **Opt-Out**: Ensure your data isn't being used to train the public model.

## Techniques for Analysis

### 1. The "Interrogator" Method
Upload a large PDF (e.g., an Annual Report).
Ask:
- "What are the top 3 risks mentioned in the CEO's letter?"
- "Compare the financial outlook of 2024 vs 2023."
- "List all mentions of 'AI' or 'Automation'."

### 2. The "Data Cleaner" Method
Upload a messy CSV where columns are misaligned or dates are in different formats.
Prompt:
> "This dataset is messy. Please standardise the date format to YYYY-MM-DD, remove any rows with missing email addresses, and output the clean version as a CSV code block."

### 3. The "Sentiment Analyst" Method
Upload a text file of customer reviews.
Prompt:
> "Analyse the sentiment of these reviews. Group them into 5 categories of complaints. Provide a quote for each category and suggest a strategic fix."

## Practical Exercise: The Data Dive

### Task
Find a public dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or a government website) or use a sanitised internal file.
Upload it to ChatGPT (Advanced Data Analysis) or Claude.

Ask the AI to:
1.  **Visualise**: Create a bar chart of the most common values.
2.  **Correlate**: Find a relationship between two variables.
3.  **Summarise**: Write a paragraph explaining the key finding to a CEO.

### Questions to Consider
- Did the AI hallucinate any patterns?
- Was the visualisation accurate?
- How would you present this to a client?

## Next Steps

Now that you have the insights, you need to put them to work.
