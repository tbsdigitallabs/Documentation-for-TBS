# Turning Strategy into Executable Workflows

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Translate high-level strategy into Jira/Linear tickets
- Use AI to generate detailed acceptance criteria
- Create "Definition of Done" checklists automatically
- Map out dependencies and timelines using AI reasoning

## The Execution Gap

The biggest failure point in consulting is the handoff.
**Strategy**: "We need to improve site speed to boost SEO."
**Execution**: *Crickets*.

Why? Because "improve site speed" isn't a task. It's a goal. A task is "Compress all images on the homepage to under 100kb."

## AI as the Project Manager

AI excels at breaking big rocks into pebbles.

### 1. Ticket Generation
Paste your strategy document into the AI.
Prompt:
> "Based on this strategy, generate a list of 10 technical tasks for the development team. Format them for Jira. Include a user story, acceptance criteria, and priority level for each."

### 2. Brief Writing
Don't write briefs from scratch.
Prompt:
> "Write a creative brief for a landing page based on this strategy kernel. The audience is [Audience]. The goal is [Goal]. Include sections for: Key Message, Visual Tone, and Mandatory Inclusions."

### 3. Critical Path Analysis
Paste your list of tasks.
Prompt:
> "Look at these tasks. Which ones are blocking others? Organise them into a logical sequence for a 4-week sprint. Identify the critical path."

## Practical Exercise: The Ticket Factory

### Task
Take the "Strategy Kernel" you created in Module 1.
Use AI to generate:
1.  **3 Epic Tickets**: High-level bodies of work.
2.  **5 Task Tickets**: Specific actions for developers or designers.
3.  **1 QA Checklist**: How will we know it's working?

### Questions to Consider
- Are the tickets specific enough for a junior developer to understand?
- Did the AI miss any obvious dependencies?
- How much editing did you have to do?

## Next Steps

You have the plan. Now you need to validate it.
Next up: **Quality Assurance and Strategic Validation**.
