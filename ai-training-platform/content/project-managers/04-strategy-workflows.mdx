# Turning Strategy into Executable Workflows

Welcome back! You've learned to create strategies and research with AI. Now comes the hard part: **actually executing that strategy**.

**This module will teach you:** How to translate high-level strategy into actionable tickets, briefs, and workflows. Think of AI as your project manager assistant who breaks big goals into small, doable tasks.

*'Strategy: "Improve site speed." Execution: *crickets* AI: Let me break that down into actual tasks. You: Finally, something we can actually do!'*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Translate high-level strategy into Jira/Linear/Asana tickets
- Use AI to generate detailed acceptance criteria
- Create 'Definition of Done' checklists automatically
- Map out dependencies and timelines using AI
- Turn strategy into actionable workflows

## The Execution Gap (Why Strategies Fail)

Let's talk about the biggest failure point in consulting: **the handoff from strategy to execution**.

### The Problem

**Strategy says:**
> "We need to improve site speed to boost SEO."

**Execution says:**
> *Crickets* 🦗

**Why?** Because "improve site speed" isn't a task. It's a goal. A task is: "Compress all images on the homepage to under 100kb."

### The Gap Explained

**High-level strategy:**
- Vague and abstract
- Hard to know where to start
- No clear steps
- Easy to ignore

**Actionable tasks:**
- Specific and concrete
- Clear starting point
- Step-by-step instructions
- Easy to assign and track

**The solution:** AI can break big goals into small tasks automatically!

![Execution Gap](https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/02022B/D56EED?text=Image)
*'The Execution Gap: Where good strategies go to die. AI: I can help bridge that gap. You: Show me how!'*

## AI as Your Project Manager (Breaking Big Rocks into Pebbles)

AI excels at breaking big problems into small, manageable pieces. Here's how to use it:

### Technique 1: Ticket Generation (From Strategy to Tasks)

**The workflow:**

**Step 1:** Paste your strategy document into AI

**Step 2:** Ask AI:
> "Based on this strategy, generate a list of 10 technical tasks for the development team. Format them for Jira. Include a user story, acceptance criteria, and priority level for each."

**What you get:**
- Specific, actionable tasks
- User stories (who, what, why)
- Acceptance criteria (how to know it's done)
- Priority levels (what to do first)

**Example output:**
```
Task 1: Compress Homepage Images
User Story: As a website visitor, I want pages to load quickly so I don't get frustrated and leave.
Acceptance Criteria:
- All images on homepage are under 100kb
- Page load time is under 2 seconds
- Images maintain visual quality
Priority: High
```

**Time saved:** Hours of breaking down strategy manually!

![Ticket Generation](https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/02022B/D56EED?text=Image)
*'Strategy: *exists* AI: Let me break that into tasks. Tasks: *appear* You: Perfect! Now we can actually do this!'*

### Technique 2: Brief Writing (From Strategy to Creative Briefs)

Don't write briefs from scratch. Let AI do it!

**The workflow:**

**Step 1:** Have your strategy kernel ready

**Step 2:** Ask AI:
> "Write a creative brief for a landing page based on this strategy kernel. The audience is [describe your audience]. The goal is [your goal]. Include sections for: Key Message, Visual Tone, and Mandatory Inclusions."

**What you get:**
- Complete creative brief
- Clear messaging
- Visual direction
- Requirements list

**Example:**
```
Creative Brief: Landing Page Redesign

Key Message: "Fast, reliable hosting that scales with your business"

Visual Tone: Modern, professional, trustworthy. Use blue and green colours. Clean, minimal design.

Mandatory Inclusions:
- Customer testimonials
- Pricing table
- Free trial CTA
- Security badges
```

**Time saved:** Writing briefs from scratch takes hours. AI does it in minutes!

![Brief Writing](https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/02022B/D56EED?text=Image)
*'Strategy: *exists* AI: Let me write a brief for that. Brief: *appears* Designers: Finally, clear direction!'*

### Technique 3: Critical Path Analysis (Finding Dependencies)

Understanding what depends on what is crucial for project planning.

**The workflow:**

**Step 1:** Paste your list of tasks

**Step 2:** Ask AI:
> "Look at these tasks. Which ones are blocking others? Organise them into a logical sequence for a 4-week sprint. Identify the critical path (the sequence that determines the shortest project duration)."

**What you get:**
- Tasks in logical order
- Dependencies identified
- Critical path highlighted
- Timeline estimate

**Example:**
```
Week 1:
- Design homepage mockups (blocks development)
- Set up development environment

Week 2:
- Develop homepage (depends on designs)
- Write content (can happen in parallel)

Week 3:
- Integrate content into homepage
- Test and fix bugs

Week 4:
- Final QA
- Deploy

Critical Path: Design → Development → Integration → QA → Deploy
```

**This shows:** What must happen in order, and what can happen in parallel!

![Critical Path](https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/02022B/D56EED?text=Image)
*'Tasks: *exist but are chaotic* AI: Let me organise these. Organised Tasks: *in logical order with dependencies* You: Now I understand the project flow!'*

## Your Practice Exercise: The Ticket Factory

Ready to turn strategy into tasks? Let's do it!

### The Challenge

Take the "Strategy Kernel" you created in Module 1 (or create a simple one now). Use AI to generate actionable tickets.

### Step 1: Generate Epic Tickets (10 minutes)

**Epic tickets** = High-level bodies of work (big chunks of the project)

**Ask AI:**
> "Based on this strategy kernel, generate 3 Epic tickets. Each epic should represent a major phase or component of the project. Include: Epic name, description, and key outcomes."

**Example:**
```
Epic 1: Homepage Redesign
Description: Complete redesign of homepage to improve user experience and conversion
Key Outcomes: Modern design, faster load times, increased conversions
```

### Step 2: Generate Task Tickets (15 minutes)

**Task tickets** = Specific actions for developers or designers

**Ask AI:**
> "Break down Epic 1 (Homepage Redesign) into 5 specific task tickets. Format for Jira/Asana. Include: Title, User Story, Acceptance Criteria, and Estimated Hours."

**Example:**
```
Task 1: Design Homepage Mockups
User Story: As a designer, I need to create homepage mockups so developers know what to build.
Acceptance Criteria:
- 3 design variations created
- Mobile and desktop versions
- Approved by client
Estimated Hours: 8
```

### Step 3: Generate QA Checklist (10 minutes)

**QA checklist** = How will we know it's working?

**Ask AI:**
> "Create a QA checklist for the homepage redesign. Include: Functional testing, visual testing, performance testing, and accessibility testing."

**Example:**
```
QA Checklist:
- [ ] All links work correctly
- [ ] Images load and display properly
- [ ] Page loads in under 2 seconds
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing complete
```

### Questions to Reflect On

- Are the tickets specific enough for a junior developer to understand?
- Did AI miss any obvious dependencies?
- How much editing did you have to do?
- Would you feel confident assigning these tickets to your team?

![Ticket Factory](https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/02022B/D56EED?text=Image)
*'Strategy: *exists* AI Ticket Factory: *generates tickets* You: Perfect! Now we have a clear plan. Team: Finally, we know what to do!'*

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Vague Task Descriptions

**The problem:** "Improve the website" is not a task

**The solution:** Always include specific actions. "Compress homepage images to under 100kb" is a task.

### Mistake #2: Missing Dependencies

**The problem:** Tasks assigned without checking what they depend on

**The solution:** Use AI to identify dependencies. Always ask: "What needs to happen first?"

### Mistake #3: No Acceptance Criteria

**The problem:** "How do we know it's done?"

**The solution:** Always include acceptance criteria. AI can generate these automatically!

### Mistake #4: Ignoring the Critical Path

**The problem:** Not understanding what tasks are blocking others

**The solution:** Use AI to identify the critical path. Focus on those tasks first!

![Common Mistakes](https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/02022B/D56EED?text=Image)
*'Mistake: Vague tasks, no dependencies, no criteria. Result: Confusion and delays. Solution: Use AI to generate proper tickets with all the details!'*
