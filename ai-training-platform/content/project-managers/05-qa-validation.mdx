# Quality Assurance and Strategic Validation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Use AI to "red team" your own work
- Automate the checking of deliverables against the original brief
- Create dynamic QA checklists based on project requirements
- Validate that the output actually solves the strategic problem

## Why QA Matters

In a fast-paced agency, QA often gets skipped. "It looks good" isn't enough.
**Strategic QA** asks: "Does this actually do what we said it would do?"

## AI as the Inspector

### 1. The "Red Team" Prompt
Before sending a document to a client, ask AI to destroy it.
Prompt:
> "You are a grumpy client who hates spending money. Read this proposal. Find 3 reasons to say no. Be specific."

### 2. The "Brief Matcher"
Upload the Original Brief and the Final Deliverable (copy).
Prompt:
> "Compare the final output against the requirements in the brief. Rate the compliance on a scale of 1-10. List any missing requirements."

### 3. The "Edge Case" Generator
For software projects, we often forget the unhappy paths.
Prompt:
> "We are building a signup flow. List 10 edge cases we might have forgotten (e.g., user has no email, user is under 18, internet cuts out)."

## Practical Exercise: The QA Gauntlet

### Task
Take a recent deliverable (an email, a report, a design mock-up description).
Run it through the "Red Team" prompt.
Then, try to fix the issues the AI identified.

### Questions to Consider
- Was the AI's feedback valid?
- Did it catch things you were "blind" to because you worked on it too long?
- How can you build this into your daily workflow?
