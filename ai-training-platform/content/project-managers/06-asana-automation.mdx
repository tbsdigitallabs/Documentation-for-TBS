# Asana Automation & AI

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Turn a messy Google Chat thread into a structured Asana task using AI
- Automate status updates so you never have to chase people
- Use AI to identify "zombie tasks" that are clogging up the board
- Generate subtasks and dependencies automatically from a brief

## The Project Management Black Hole

We spend 30% of our time *doing* the work, and 70% of our time *managing* the work.
Asana is great, but manual data entry is the enemy.
AI + Automation is the cure.

### 1. Google Chat to Asana (The Smart Way)
Don't copy-paste.
**Workflow**:
1.  Zapier/Make triggers when you star a message in Google Chat.
2.  AI parses the message: "Extract the Action Item, Due Date, and Assignee."
3.  Asana creates the task.

**Prompt for the AI step**:
> "Read this chat message. Identify the core task.
> If it's a bug, format the title as '[BUG] - {Issue}'.
> If it's a feature, format as '[FEAT] - {Feature}'.
> Extract the due date if mentioned (default to next Friday if not)."

### 2. The "Zombie Task" Hunter
Projects get bloated with tasks nobody intends to do.
Export your CSV. Upload to ChatGPT.
**Prompt**:
> "Analyse this list of 500 tasks.
> Identify tasks that haven't been updated in 30 days but are not marked complete.
> Suggest which ones should be archived based on their low priority."

### 3. Brief to Subtasks
Paste a client email or PDF brief.
**Prompt**:
> "Break this project down into Asana subtasks.
> Group them by phase (Design, Dev, QA).
> Estimate hours for each.
> Output as a CSV format I can import directly into Asana."

## Practical Exercise: The Board Cleanup

### Task
1.  **Export**: Download a CSV of your messiest Asana project.
2.  **Analyse**: Use AI to find the "bottleneck" (the person with the most overdue tasks).
3.  **Automate**: Set up a rule (or draft the logic for one) that auto-moves tasks to "Done" when a PR is merged (if using Jira/Github sync) or when a checkbox is ticked.

### Questions to Consider
-   Did the AI correctly identify the bottleneck?
-   How much time would it take to manually clean that board?
-   Are your task titles clear enough for an AI to understand?

## Next Steps

Your tasks are organised. Now let's fix your meetings.
Next up: **Meeting Governance & Summaries**.
