# Meeting Governance & Summaries

Welcome to the final project manager module! This one is about something we all struggle with: **meetings that could have been emails, and forgetting what was discussed**.

**This module will teach you:** How to generate perfect meeting minutes without taking notes, extract hidden action items, and create a 'Decision Log' that tracks why decisions were made. Think of AI as your perfect meeting memory.

*'Meetings: We sit, we nod, we forget. AI: I remember everything. You: Finally, someone who pays attention!'*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Generate perfect meeting minutes without taking a single note
- Extract 'hidden' action items that usually get forgotten
- Create a 'Decision Log' that tracks why decisions were made
- Use AI to facilitate meetings (agenda generation)
- Never forget what was discussed again

## The "This Could Have Been an Email" Crisis

Let's be honest about meetings.

### The Problem

**Common meeting experience:**
1. We sit in meetings
2. We nod along
3. We forget what was discussed
4. We have another meeting to discuss what we forgot
5. Repeat forever

**The cycle:**
- Meeting → Forget → Another Meeting → Forget → Another Meeting

**The waste:**
- Hours of time
- Important decisions forgotten
- Action items lost
- Frustration

### The Solution

AI breaks this cycle by creating a **Perfect Memory** of every meeting.

**How it works:**
- Record or transcribe the meeting
- AI extracts key information
- You query what you need
- Never forget again!

*'The Meeting Cycle: Meet → Forget → Meet Again → Forget. AI: I can break this cycle. You: Show me how!'*

## Technique 1: The Transcript Pipeline (Perfect Meeting Minutes)

Don't take notes. Let AI do it!

### The Tools

**Recording/Transcription tools:**
- **Otter.ai** - Automatic transcription
- **Fireflies.ai** - Meeting recording and AI summaries
- **Teams/Zoom AI** - Built-in transcription
- **Google Meet** - Automatic transcripts

**The secret:** It's not about the transcript. It's about the *query*.

### The Old Way (Why It's Inefficient)

**Traditional approach:**
1. Try to take notes while listening
2. Miss important points
3. Forget action items
4. Have to read entire transcript later
5. Still miss things

**Time:** 1 hour meeting + 30 minutes reading transcript = 1.5 hours

### The New Way (Using AI Queries)

**AI-powered approach:**
1. Record the meeting (automatic)
2. Get transcript (automatic)
3. Query AI for what you need:
   > "Based on this transcript, list the 3 decisions we made. For each decision, quote the person who made the final call. List the 5 action items and who owns them."
4. Get instant answers

**Time:** 1 hour meeting + 2 minutes querying = 1 hour 2 minutes

**Time saved:** 28 minutes per meeting!

![Transcript Pipeline](https://media.giphy.com/media/citBl9yPwnUOs/giphy.gif)
*'Meeting: *happens* Transcript: *exists* You: What did we decide? AI: *queries transcript* Answer: *appears instantly* You: Perfect! No reading required!'*

### Example: Extracting Key Information

**Your query:**
> "Based on this transcript, list the 3 decisions we made. For each decision, quote the person who made the final call. List the 5 action items and who owns them."

**AI response:**
> "**Decisions Made:**
> 1. **Use blue colour scheme** - Final call by Sarah: 'Let's go with blue, it matches the brand better.'
> 2. **Launch date: 15th March** - Final call by Mike: '15th March gives us enough time for QA.'
> 3. **Add customer testimonials** - Final call by Lisa: 'Testimonials will increase trust.'
> 
> **Action Items:**
> 1. Sarah: Finalise blue colour palette (Due: Friday)
> 2. Mike: Create project timeline (Due: Monday)
> 3. Lisa: Collect customer testimonials (Due: Next week)
> 4. Tom: Set up staging environment (Due: Wednesday)
> 5. You: Send meeting summary to team (Due: Today)"

**See?** All the important information extracted instantly!

## Technique 2: The "Did We Agree?" Search (Finding Past Decisions)

Client says you agreed to something. You don't remember. AI can find it!

### The Problem

**Common scenario:**
- Client: "You said you'd do the logo in pink."
- You: "I don't think so."
- Client: "Yes, you did!"
- You: *Panic* "Let me check..."

**The solution:** Search all past meetings instantly!

### How to Use It

**Step 1:** Have your meeting transcripts stored (Otter.ai, Fireflies, etc.)

**Step 2:** Ask AI:
> "Search all transcripts from Client X in the last 3 months. Find any mention of 'logo colour' or 'pink'. Summarise the context."

**Step 3:** Get instant answer

**Step 4:** Know exactly what was discussed!

### Example: Finding Past Agreement

**Your query:**
> "Search all transcripts from Acme Corp in the last 3 months. Find any mention of 'logo colour' or 'pink'."

**AI response:**
> "**Found in Meeting: 15th January 2024**
> 
> **Context:** Discussion about brand colours
> 
> **Quote:** Client: 'Can we make the logo pink?' You: 'We can explore that option.' Client: 'Great, let's do pink then.' You: 'I'll note that down.'
> 
> **Conclusion:** You did discuss pink as a logo colour option, but it wasn't a firm commitment. The client interpreted it as agreement."

**See?** Now you know exactly what was said and can respond appropriately!

![Did We Agree](https://media.giphy.com/media/citBl9yPwnUOs/giphy.gif)
*'Client: "You said pink!" You: "Did I?" AI: *searches transcripts* AI: "Yes, you discussed it but didn't commit." You: "Ah, now I remember!"'*

## Technique 3: Pre-Meeting Briefs (Don't Go In Cold)

Don't go into meetings unprepared. AI can brief you!

### The Problem

**Common scenario:**
- Meeting in 10 minutes
- You forgot what you discussed last time
- You go in cold
- You look unprepared
- You miss important context

### The Solution

**Step 1:** Before the meeting, ask AI:
> "I have a meeting with [Client Name] in 10 minutes. Summarise our last 3 email threads and the last meeting notes. What are the open issues I need to resolve today?"

**Step 2:** Get instant briefing

**Step 3:** Go into meeting prepared!

### Example: Pre-Meeting Brief

**Your query:**
> "I have a meeting with Acme Corp in 10 minutes. Summarise our last 3 email threads and the last meeting notes. What are the open issues I need to resolve today?"

**AI response:**
> "**Last Meeting Summary (2 weeks ago):**
> - Discussed website redesign
> - Agreed on blue colour scheme
> - Launch date: 15th March
> 
> **Recent Emails:**
> - Client asked about adding blog section (you haven't responded)
> - Client wants to change launch date to 1st March (needs discussion)
> - Client sent new logo files (you need to confirm receipt)
> 
> **Open Issues to Resolve:**
> 1. Blog section: Yes or no? (affects timeline)
> 2. Launch date: Can we do 1st March? (2 weeks earlier)
> 3. New logo files: Confirm you received them
> 
> **Action Items from Last Meeting:**
> - You: Send design mockups (Status: Sent, awaiting feedback)"

**See?** You're now prepared for the meeting!

![Pre-Meeting Brief](https://media.giphy.com/media/citBl9yPwnUOs/giphy.gif)
*'Meeting in 10 minutes: *panic* AI: Let me brief you. Brief: *appears* You: Now I'm prepared! Meeting: *goes smoothly*'*

## Your Practice Exercise: The Governance Audit

Ready to try this yourself? Let's audit a meeting!

### The Challenge

Take a recording (or transcript) of your last internal WIP (Work In Progress) meeting. If you don't have one, use a sample meeting transcript.

### Step 1: Summarise (10 minutes)

**What to do:**
1. Upload the transcript to AI
2. Ask AI:
   > "Generate a 'One-Pager' summary of this meeting for someone who missed it. Include: Key decisions, action items, and important discussions."
3. Review the summary

### Step 2: Audit Efficiency (5 minutes)

**What to do:**
1. Ask AI:
   > "Was this meeting efficient? How much time was spent on small talk vs problem solving? What could have been an email instead?"
2. Review the feedback
3. Think about how to improve future meetings

### Step 3: Draft Follow-Up Email (5 minutes)

**What to do:**
1. Ask AI:
   > "Draft a follow-up email to the team based on this meeting. Include: Decisions made, action items with owners, and next steps."
2. Review and send (or refine first)

### Step 4: Create Decision Log Entry (10 minutes)

**What to do:**
1. Ask AI:
   > "Create a Decision Log entry for this meeting. For each decision, include: What was decided, who made the decision, why it was decided, and when it was decided."
2. Save this for future reference

### Questions to Reflect On

- Did AI capture the nuance of the discussion?
- Did it miss any sarcasm? (AI struggles with sarcasm, so always review!)
- How much time did you save on the follow-up email?
- Would you use this for all meetings going forward?

![Governance Audit](https://media.giphy.com/media/citBl9yPwnUOs/giphy.gif)
*'Meeting: *happened* AI Audit: *analyses* Summary: *appears* Follow-up: *drafted* Decision Log: *created* You: Perfect! Everything documented!'*

## Creating a Decision Log (Why It Matters)

A Decision Log tracks **what** was decided and **why**. This is invaluable!

### What is a Decision Log?

**Decision Log** = A record of:
- What decisions were made
- Who made them
- Why they were made
- When they were made
- What the alternatives were

### Why It Matters

**Common problem:**
- 6 months later: "Why did we decide to use blue?"
- Nobody remembers
- You have to re-discuss
- Time wasted

**With Decision Log:**
- 6 months later: "Why did we decide to use blue?"
- Check Decision Log
- "Because client's brand guidelines require it"
- Question answered instantly!

### How to Create It

**After each meeting, ask AI:**
> "Create a Decision Log entry for this meeting. For each decision, include: What was decided, who made the decision, why it was decided, what alternatives were considered, and when it was decided."

**Save these entries** in a shared document or system.

**Example Decision Log Entry:**
```
Decision: Use blue colour scheme for website
Date: 15th January 2024
Decision Maker: Sarah (Creative Director)
Reason: Matches client's brand guidelines and existing marketing materials
Alternatives Considered: Green (rejected - doesn't match brand), Red (rejected - too aggressive)
Context: Client requested brand-consistent colours
```

**See?** Now you'll never forget why decisions were made!

![Decision Log](https://media.giphy.com/media/citBl9yPwnUOs/giphy.gif)
*'Decision Log: Because "Why did we decide that?" shouldn't require another meeting. AI: I'll track every decision. You: Perfect memory!'*

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Not Using Transcripts

**The problem:** Relying on memory or incomplete notes

**The solution:** Always record/transcribe important meetings. It's free with most tools!

### Mistake #2: Reading Entire Transcripts

**The problem:** Spending hours reading transcripts

**The solution:** Query AI for what you need. Don't read everything!

### Mistake #3: Not Creating Decision Logs

**The problem:** Forgetting why decisions were made

**The solution:** Create Decision Log entries after every meeting. AI makes it fast!

### Mistake #4: Ignoring Sarcasm

**The problem:** AI might miss sarcasm or jokes

**The solution:** Always review AI summaries. AI is helpful but not perfect!

![Common Mistakes](https://media.giphy.com/media/citBl9yPwnUOs/giphy.gif)
*'Mistake: Not documenting meetings. Result: "What did we decide?" requires another meeting. Solution: AI transcripts + Decision Log. Time: 5 minutes. Result: Perfect memory!'*
