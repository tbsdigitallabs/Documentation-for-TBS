# Meeting Governance & Summaries

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Generate perfect meeting minutes without taking a single note
- Extract "hidden" action items that usually get forgotten
- Create a "Decision Log" that tracks *why* we did something
- Use AI to facilitate the meeting (agenda generation)

## The "This Could Have Been an Email" Crisis

We sit in meetings. We nod. We forget.
Then we have another meeting to discuss what we forgot.
AI breaks this cycle by creating a **Perfect Memory**.

### 1. The Transcript Pipeline
Tools: **Otter.ai**, **Fireflies**, or **Teams/Zoom AI**.
**The Secret**: It's not about the transcript. It's about the *query*.
Don't just read the wall of text.
**Prompt**:
> "Based on this transcript, list the 3 decisions we made.
> For each decision, quote the person who made the final call.
> List the 5 action items and who owns them."

### 2. The "Did We Agree?" Search
Client says: "You said you'd do the logo in pink."
You say: "I don't think so."
**AI Search**:
> "Search all transcripts from Client X in the last 3 months. Find any mention of 'logo colour' or 'pink'. Summarise the context."

### 3. Pre-Meeting Briefs
Don't go in cold.
**Prompt**:
> "I have a meeting with [Client Name] in 10 minutes.
> Summarise our last 3 email threads and the last meeting notes.
> What are the open issues I need to resolve today?"

## Practical Exercise: The Governance Audit

### Task
Take a recording (or transcript) of your last internal WIP meeting.
1.  **Summarise**: Generate a "One-Pager" summary for someone who missed it.
2.  **Audit**: Ask AI "Was this meeting efficient? How much time was spent on small talk vs problem solving?"
3.  **Action**: Draft the follow-up email to the team.

### Questions to Consider
-   Did the AI capture the nuance of the discussion?
-   Did it miss any sarcasm? (AI struggles with sarcasm).
-   How much time did you save on the follow-up email?

## Next Steps

You've mastered the PM Admin track.
Your projects are clean. Your meetings are documented.
You are unstoppable.
