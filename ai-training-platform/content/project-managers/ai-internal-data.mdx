## The Hidden Goldmine (Data You Already Have)

Most organisations sit on a mountain of data they never use. Let's talk about what you might have:

### Types of Internal Data

**Sales Logs**
- Who bought what and when?
- What are the patterns?
- Which products sell together?

**Customer Support Tickets**
- What are people complaining about?
- What are the common issues?
- How can we prevent problems?

**Meeting Transcripts**
- What did we actually agree to?
- What decisions were made?
- Who owns which action items?

**Email Threads**
- What are clients asking for?
- What are the common themes?
- What did we promise?

**Project Files**
- What worked in past projects?
- What didn't work?
- What can we learn?

**The problem:** This data exists, but it's hard to analyse without technical skills.

**The solution:** AI lets you 'chat' with your data without needing to be a SQL expert!

![Hidden Data](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9IgzoKnwFNmISR8I/giphy.gif)
*'Your Company: We have all this data! Also Your Company: But we don't know what it means. AI: Let me help you understand it!'*

## Security First (This is Critical!)

Before we dive into analysis, let's talk about security. This is **the most important part** of this module.

### Rule #1: Anonymise Personal Information

**What is PII?** Personally Identifiable Information:
- Names
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Addresses
- Any information that identifies a person

**What to do:**
- Remove PII before uploading to public AI tools
- Replace names with "User 1", "User 2", etc.
- Remove email addresses and phone numbers
- Only use enterprise-grade tools (like TBS Enterprise ChatGPT) for sensitive data

**Why it matters:**
- Privacy laws (GDPR, Australian Privacy Act)
- Client confidentiality
- Ethical responsibility
- Legal compliance

![Security First](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9IgzoKnwFNmISR8I/giphy.gif)
*'Security: Always first. Privacy: Always important. AI: I can help, but only with safe data. You: Got it!'*

### Rule #2: Check Client NDAs

**Before uploading client data:**
1. Read the client's NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)
2. Does it allow third-party processing?
3. Is the AI tool you're using approved?
4. When in doubt, ask your legal team or manager

**Safe approach:**
- Use enterprise AI tools (approved by your company)
- Anonymise data before uploading
- Get approval for sensitive projects

### Rule #3: Opt-Out of Training

**Important:** Make sure your data isn't being used to train public AI models.

**How to check:**
- Look for 'Training Data' or 'Model Training' settings
- Turn off data training/sharing
- Use enterprise tools that don't train on your data

**Why it matters:**
- Your data could appear in responses to other users
- Client confidentiality could be breached
- Competitive information could leak

![Privacy Settings](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9IgzoKnwFNmISR8I/giphy.gif)
*'AI Tool: Use your data to train our model? You: NO. Also You: *turns off training* Privacy: Protected!'*

## Technique 1: The "Interrogator" Method (Analysing Documents)

This technique lets you ask questions about large documents.

### When to Use This

- Annual reports
- Long strategy documents
- Client briefs
- Research papers
- Any large PDF or document

### How It Works

**Step 1:** Upload the document to ChatGPT or Claude

**Step 2:** Ask specific questions:

> "What are the top 3 risks mentioned in the CEO's letter?"

> "Compare the financial outlook of 2024 vs 2023."

> "List all mentions of 'AI' or 'Automation' and summarise the context."

**Step 3:** Get instant answers without reading the whole document!

### Example: Analysing an Annual Report

**The document:** 50-page annual report

**Your questions:**
1. "What are the main challenges the company faces?"
2. "What are their growth strategies?"
3. "How does this year compare to last year?"

**Time saved:** Reading 50 pages = 2 hours. AI analysis = 5 minutes!

![Document Analysis](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9IgzoKnwFNmISR8I/giphy.gif)
*'50-page document: *exists* You: I need to understand this. AI: Ask me anything. You: What are the key points? AI: *summarises in 30 seconds* You: This is magic!'*

## Technique 2: The "Data Cleaner" Method (Fixing Messy Data)

Real-world data is messy. AI can clean it up!

### The Problem with Real Data

**Common issues:**
- Dates in different formats (DD/MM/YYYY, MM-DD-YYYY, etc.)
- Missing information
- Misaligned columns
- Inconsistent formatting
- Duplicate entries

**Manual cleaning:** Hours of tedious work

**AI cleaning:** Minutes of work!

### How to Clean Data with AI

**Step 1:** Upload your messy CSV

**Step 2:** Ask AI:
> "This dataset is messy. Please:
> - Standardise the date format to YYYY-MM-DD
> - Remove any rows with missing email addresses
> - Fix misaligned columns
> - Remove duplicate entries
> - Output the clean version as a CSV code block."

**Step 3:** Copy the cleaned data and use it!

### Example: Cleaning Customer Data

**Messy data:**
```
Name,Email,Date
John,john@email,15/01/2024
Jane,,2024-02-20
Bob,bob@email,20-03-2024
John,john@email,15/01/2024  (duplicate)
```

**AI cleans it:**
```
Name,Email,Date
John,john@email,2024-01-15
Bob,bob@email,2024-03-20
```

**Clean, standardised, ready to use!**

![Data Cleaning](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9IgzoKnwFNmISR8I/giphy.gif)
*'Messy Data: Dates in 5 formats, missing info, duplicates. AI: *cleans it* Clean Data: Perfect, standardised, ready to use. You: How did you do that so fast?!'*

## Technique 3: The "Sentiment Analyst" Method (Understanding Feelings)

Want to know how customers really feel? Analyse their text!

### When to Use This

- Customer reviews
- Support tickets
- Feedback forms
- Social media comments
- Any text feedback

### How It Works

**Step 1:** Upload your text data (reviews, tickets, etc.)

**Step 2:** Ask AI:
> "Analyse the sentiment of these reviews. Group them into 5 categories of complaints. Provide a quote for each category and suggest a strategic fix."

**What you get:**
- Understanding of customer sentiment
- Categorised issues
- Real quotes from customers
- Suggested solutions

### Example: Analysing Customer Reviews

**Your data:** 100 customer reviews

**AI analysis:**
> "Sentiment Analysis Results:
> 
> **Category 1: Slow Response Time (35 reviews)**
> Quote: 'Took 3 days to get a response'
> Fix: Implement automated responses and set response time targets
> 
> **Category 2: Product Quality Issues (28 reviews)**
> Quote: 'Product broke after 2 weeks'
> Fix: Review quality control processes
> 
> **Category 3: Shipping Problems (20 reviews)**
> Quote: 'Package arrived damaged'
> Fix: Improve packaging and shipping partners
> 
> ...and so on"

**See?** Actionable insights from raw text!

![Sentiment Analysis](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9IgzoKnwFNmISR8I/giphy.gif)
*'100 Reviews: *exist* You: What do customers think? AI: *analyses sentiment* You: 35% complain about response time. Also you: We should fix that!'*

## Your Practice Exercise: The Data Dive

Ready to analyse some data? Let's do it!

### Step 1: Find Your Data

**Options:**
- Use a public dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Use a sanitised internal file (with PII removed!)
- Create a sample dataset for practice

**Don't have data?** That's okay! Use this example: A CSV of customer orders with dates, products, and amounts.

### Step 2: Upload to AI

**Tools to use:**
- ChatGPT (Advanced Data Analysis feature)
- Claude (can handle file uploads)
- Enterprise AI tools (if approved)

**Upload your CSV or data file.**

### Step 3: Visualise the Data

**Ask AI:**
> "Create a bar chart showing the most common values in the [column name] column."

**What you get:** A visualisation that helps you understand the data!

### Step 4: Find Relationships

**Ask AI:**
> "Find a relationship between [column 1] and [column 2]. What patterns do you see?"

**Example:**
> "Find a relationship between order date and order amount. Do people spend more at certain times?"

**What you get:** Insights about correlations and patterns!

### Step 5: Summarise for Leadership

**Ask AI:**
> "Write a paragraph explaining the key finding from this data. Write it for a CEO who doesn't have time for details."

**What you get:** Executive summary that's clear and actionable!

### Questions to Reflect On

- Did AI find any patterns you didn't expect?
- Were the visualisations accurate?
- How would you present this to a client or manager?
- Did AI 'hallucinate' any patterns that aren't real? (Always verify!)

![Data Dive](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9IgzoKnwFNmISR8I/giphy.gif)
*'Data: *exists but is confusing* AI: Let me analyse that for you. Insights: *appear* You: Oh! Now I understand what this data means!'*

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Uploading Sensitive Data

**The problem:** Uploading client data or PII to public AI tools

**The solution:** Always anonymise first. Use enterprise tools for sensitive data.

### Mistake #2: Trusting AI Analysis Blindly

**The problem:** Assuming AI found real patterns

**The solution:** Always verify. Check the data yourself. AI can 'hallucinate' patterns.

### Mistake #3: Not Understanding the Data

**The problem:** Asking AI to analyse data you don't understand

**The solution:** Understand your data first. Then ask AI to help you analyse it.

### Mistake #4: Ignoring Privacy Settings

**The problem:** Data being used to train public models

**The solution:** Always check and disable training data options.

![Common Mistakes](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9IgzoKnwFNmISR8I/giphy.gif)
*'Mistake: Uploading sensitive data without thinking. Reality: Privacy laws exist for a reason. Solution: Always anonymise, always check settings!'*
