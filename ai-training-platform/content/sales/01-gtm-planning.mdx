# Go to Market Planning and Execution

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Structure a comprehensive GTM plan using AI
- Identify ideal customer profiles (ICPs) with data-backed precision
- Map the buyer journey from awareness to conversion
- Create sales collateral that actually addresses objections

## What is GTM?

Go-to-Market (GTM) is the plan for how you will sell your product to your customers.
It's not just "marketing". It's the intersection of Product, Marketing, and Sales.

## AI for GTM Strategy

### 1. ICP Development
Don't guess who your customer is.
Prompt:
> "I am selling a SaaS tool for inventory management to small cafes.
> Describe the daily life of a cafe owner.
> What are their top 3 pain points?
> What software do they currently use?
> Where do they hang out online?"

### 2. Competitor Analysis
Prompt:
> "Compare [Our Product] vs [Competitor X].
> Create a battle card for our sales team.
> Highlight our strengths and their weaknesses.
> Be honest about where they beat us."

### 3. Messaging Matrix
Create a matrix that maps features to benefits for each persona.
- **Persona**: Cafe Owner.
- **Feature**: Auto-ordering.
- **Benefit**: "Sleep in an extra hour because you don't have to call suppliers at 5am."

## Practical Exercise: The Battle Card

### Task
Choose a product you know well.
Pick a major competitor.
Use AI to generate a one-page "Sales Battle Card" containing:
1.  **The Kill Shot**: The one reason we win every time.
2.  **Landmines**: Traps to set for the competitor.
3.  **Objection Handling**: What to say when they mention price.

### Questions to Consider
- Is the "Kill Shot" actually compelling?
- Did the AI find real weaknesses or just generic ones?
- Would you feel confident using this in a sales call?

## Next Steps

You have the plan. Now you need leads.
