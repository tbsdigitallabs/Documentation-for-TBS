## What is GTM? (The Simple Version)

Let's start with the basics. **Go-to-Market (GTM)** is the plan for how you will sell your product to your customers.

**It's not just "marketing."** It's the intersection of:
- **Product**: What you're selling
- **Marketing**: How you'll reach customers
- **Sales**: How you'll close deals

**Think of it like this:**
- **Marketing** = Getting people interested
- **Sales** = Converting interest into customers
- **GTM** = The strategy that connects them both

**At its core:** GTM answers the question: "How do we get our product into the hands of the right customers at the right time?"

*'GTM: Product + Marketing + Sales = Success. You: How do I plan that? AI: Let me help you build a comprehensive strategy!'*

## AI for GTM Strategy (Your Planning Assistant)

AI can help you build a GTM strategy faster and more thoroughly than doing it manually. Here's how:

### Technique 1: ICP Development (Know Your Customer)

Don't guess who your customer is. Use AI to build a detailed profile based on data.

**The old way:**
- "Our customers are small businesses"
- Too vague
- No real understanding
- Hard to target effectively

**The new way:**
> "I am selling a SaaS tool for inventory management to small cafes. Describe the daily life of a cafe owner. What are their top 3 pain points? What software do they currently use? Where do they hang out online?"

**What you get:**
- Detailed customer profile
- Understanding of their daily challenges
- Knowledge of their current tools
- Where to reach them

**Example output:**
> "Cafe owners typically:
> - Start work at 5am
> - Struggle with inventory tracking (waste, running out of stock)
> - Use spreadsheets or pen and paper
> - Are active on Instagram and local business Facebook groups
> - Value time-saving tools over fancy features"

**See?** Much more specific and actionable!

![ICP Development](/images/icp-development.jpg)
*'Old Way: "Our customers are small businesses." New Way: Detailed profile with pain points, tools, and where to find them. AI: I can help you understand your customers!'*

### Technique 2: Competitor Analysis (Know Your Competition)

Understanding your competition is crucial. AI can help you analyse them objectively.

**Ask AI:**
> "Compare [Our Product] vs [Competitor X]. Create a battle card for our sales team. Highlight our strengths and their weaknesses. Be honest about where they beat us."

**What you get:**
- Objective comparison
- Your competitive advantages
- Their weaknesses (where you can win)
- Honest assessment of where they're better

**Example output:**
> "**Our Strengths:**
> - Better pricing (30% cheaper)
> - Easier to use (no training needed)
> - Better customer support
> 
> **Their Strengths:**
> - More features (but most customers don't use them)
> - Better brand recognition
> 
> **How to Win:**
> - Focus on value and ease of use
> - Highlight support quality
> - Address feature concerns: 'Do you actually need those extra features?'"

**See?** Actionable insights for your sales team!

![Competitor Analysis](/images/competitor-analysis.jpg)
*'Competitor: *exists* AI Analysis: *finds strengths and weaknesses* You: Now I know how to compete. Sales Team: Finally, a battle card that actually helps!'*

### Technique 3: Messaging Matrix (Features to Benefits)

Features don't sell—benefits do. AI can help you translate features into benefits that resonate.

**The concept:**
Create a matrix that maps features to benefits for each persona.

**Example:**
- **Persona**: Cafe Owner
- **Feature**: Auto-ordering
- **Benefit**: "Sleep in an extra hour because you don't have to call suppliers at 5am"

**How AI helps:**
> "For a cafe owner persona, translate this feature into a benefit: Auto-ordering inventory when stock runs low. Focus on what it means for their daily life."

**What you get:**
- Benefits that actually matter to your customer
- Language that resonates
- Clear value proposition
- Ready to use in sales conversations

**The key:** Benefits answer "What's in it for me?" Features just describe what it does.

![Messaging Matrix](/images/messaging-matrix.jpg)
*'Feature: Auto-ordering. Benefit: Sleep in an extra hour. Customer: Now I'm interested! You: That's the power of benefits over features!'*

## Your Practice Exercise: The Battle Card

Ready to create a sales battle card? Let's do it!

### The Challenge

Choose a product you know well (or use a hypothetical one). Pick a major competitor. Use AI to generate a complete sales battle card.

### Step 1: Choose Your Product and Competitor (5 minutes)

**Pick:**
- A product you understand
- A major competitor
- A specific customer persona

**Example:**
- Product: "Cloud-based project management tool"
- Competitor: "Asana"
- Persona: "Small agency owner"

### Step 2: Generate the Battle Card (20 minutes)

**Ask AI:**
> "Create a one-page Sales Battle Card for [Our Product] vs [Competitor]. Include:
> 1. **The Kill Shot**: The one reason we win every time
> 2. **Landmines**: Traps to set for the competitor (questions that expose their weaknesses)
> 3. **Objection Handling**: What to say when they mention price, features, or switching costs
> 4. **Our Strengths**: Top 3 advantages
> 5. **Their Weaknesses**: Top 3 disadvantages
> 
> Format it for a sales rep to use in a call."

**Review the battle card:**
- Is the 'Kill Shot' actually compelling?
- Are the landmines effective?
- Does objection handling sound natural?
- Would you feel confident using this?

### Step 3: Refine and Test (10 minutes)

**Ask AI:**
> "Review this battle card. Is the 'Kill Shot' actually compelling? Would a customer care? How can we make it stronger?"

**Refine based on feedback** and make it your own.

### Questions to Reflect On

- Is the 'Kill Shot' actually compelling?
- Did AI find real weaknesses or just generic ones?
- Would you feel confident using this in a sales call?
- How much time did this save vs. creating it manually?

![Battle Card](/images/battle-card.jpg)
*'Battle Card: Complete competitive strategy. Time: 35 minutes. Manual: Would take 4 hours. Sales Team: Finally, we know how to compete!'*

## Mapping the Buyer Journey (From Awareness to Conversion)

Understanding how customers buy helps you sell better.

### The Buyer Journey Stages

**Stage 1: Awareness**
- Customer realises they have a problem
- They start researching solutions
- **Your job:** Get in front of them with helpful content

**Stage 2: Consideration**
- Customer is evaluating options
- They're comparing solutions
- **Your job:** Show why you're the best choice

**Stage 3: Decision**
- Customer is ready to buy
- They're choosing between final options
- **Your job:** Address final objections and close

### How AI Helps Map the Journey

**Ask AI:**
> "For a [customer persona] buying [your product], map their buyer journey. For each stage (Awareness, Consideration, Decision), identify:
> - What questions do they have?
> - What content do they need?
> - What objections might they have?
> - How do we help them move to the next stage?"

**What you get:**
- Clear understanding of each stage
- Content needs for each stage
- Objections to prepare for
- Strategy for moving customers forward

![Buyer Journey](/images/buyer-journey.jpg)
*'Buyer Journey: Awareness → Consideration → Decision. AI: I can help you map each stage. You: Now I know what to say at each point!'*

## Creating Sales Collateral (That Actually Works)

Sales collateral should help you sell, not just look pretty. AI can help you create collateral that addresses real objections.

### The Problem with Generic Collateral

**Generic collateral:**
- Lists features
- Doesn't address objections
- Sounds like marketing
- Doesn't help close deals

**Good sales collateral:**
- Addresses specific objections
- Answers real questions
- Helps the sales conversation
- Actually helps close deals

### How AI Helps

**Ask AI:**
> "Create a one-pager for [product] that addresses these common objections:
> 1. 'It's too expensive'
> 2. 'We already have a solution'
> 3. 'We're not ready to switch'
> 
> For each objection, provide: The concern, our response, and proof points. Make it conversational, not marketing-y."

**What you get:**
- Collateral that addresses real concerns
- Natural language (not corporate speak)
- Proof points that matter
- Ready to use in sales conversations

![Sales Collateral](/images/sales-collateral.jpg)
*'Generic Collateral: *gets ignored* AI-Generated Collateral: *addresses objections* Sales Rep: Finally, something that actually helps me sell!'*

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Vague Customer Profiles

**The problem:** "Our customers are businesses" (too vague)

**The solution:** Use AI to create detailed ICPs with specific characteristics, pain points, and behaviours.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Competition

**The problem:** Not understanding how you compare

**The solution:** Use AI to analyse competitors objectively. Know your strengths and weaknesses.

### Mistake #3: Feature-Focused Messaging

**The problem:** Talking about features instead of benefits

**The solution:** Use AI to translate features into benefits that matter to your customer.

### Mistake #4: Generic Sales Collateral

**The problem:** Collateral that doesn't address real objections

**The solution:** Use AI to create collateral that addresses specific concerns and helps close deals.
