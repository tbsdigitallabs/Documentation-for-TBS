# Lead Generation Systems and Processes

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Automate list building using AI and data tools
- Write cold outreach emails that get replies
- Set up a multi-channel sequence (Email, LinkedIn, Phone)
- Score leads based on intent signals

## The Death of "Spray and Pray"

Sending 1000 generic emails doesn't work anymore.
You need **Relevance** at **Scale**.
AI allows you to personalise every single message based on data.

## The Modern Outbound Stack

1.  **Data Source**: Apollo, ZoomInfo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator.
2.  **Enrichment**: Clay, Clearbit.
3.  **AI Personalisation**: ChatGPT API, Claude.
4.  **Sending**: Instantly, Smartlead, Outreach.

## AI Personalisation at Scale

Don't just insert {{FirstName}}.
Use AI to read their LinkedIn profile and write a custom opener.

**The Prompt:**
> "Read this LinkedIn bio: [Insert Bio].
> Write a 1-sentence icebreaker that compliments them on a specific achievement.
> Keep it casual. Don't sound like a stalker."

**The Result:**
"Saw you just expanded to Brisbane – congrats on the growth!"
(Much better than "I hope this email finds you well.")

## Practical Exercise: The Cold Email Rewrite

### Task
Take a terrible cold email you've received (or write a generic one).
Use AI to rewrite it using the **PSA Framework**:
1.  **Problem**: "I see you're hiring for sales, which usually means chaos in the CRM."
2.  **Solution**: "We automate the data entry so reps can just sell."
3.  **Action**: "Worth a chat?"

### Questions to Consider
- Which version would you reply to?
- How long did it take the AI to rewrite it?
- Can you automate this for 100 leads?

You've completed the Sales Track!

1.  Plan your GTM.
