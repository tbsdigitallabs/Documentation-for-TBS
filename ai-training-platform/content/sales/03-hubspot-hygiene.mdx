- Keep your pipeline clean without spending Friday afternoon on it

## "If it's not in HubSpot, it didn't happen."

We all hate hearing that.
But dirty data kills deals.
The solution isn't discipline. It's automation.

### 1. The Business Card Scanner
Stop typing names.
Use the HubSpot Mobile App (or a dedicated AI scanner).
**Workflow**:
1.  Scan card.
2.  AI extracts Name, Title, Company, Email.
3.  **Enrichment**: Zapier triggers a lookup (Clearbit/Apollo) to add Company Size, Industry, and Location.

### 2. Email Sentiment Analysis
You have 50 open deals. Who do you call?
AI analyses the last email from each prospect.
**Prompt**:
> "Read the last email from these 10 leads.
> Score their 'Buying Intent' from 1-10.
> Flag any objections (e.g., 'Budget', 'Timing').
> Suggest the top 3 to call today."

### 3. The "Stalled Deal" Wake-Up
Deals rot in the "Proposal Sent" stage.
**Automation**:
If a deal sits in "Proposal" for > 14 days with no activity:
1.  AI drafts a "check-in" email (referencing the specific proposal details).
2.  Task is created for the rep: "Review and Send Wake-Up Email".

## Practical Exercise: The Pipeline Purge

### Task
1.  **Audit**: Look at your "Closed Lost" reasons for the last quarter.
2.  **Analyse**: Ask AI "What is the most common reason we lose deals? Is there a pattern in the company size or industry?"
3.  **Clean**: Use an AI tool to identify duplicate contacts and merge them.

### Questions to Consider
-   Did the analysis reveal a weakness in your pitch?
-   How many duplicates did you find?
-   Did the "Wake-Up" email draft sound human?

## Next Steps

Your data is clean. Now let's report on it.
