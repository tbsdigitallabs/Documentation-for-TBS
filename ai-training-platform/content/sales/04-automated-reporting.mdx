# Automated Reporting & Forecasting

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Generate your Weekly Sales Report in 30 seconds
- Forecast revenue using data, not "gut feel"
- Identify "At-Risk" accounts before they churn
- Impress your boss with insights they didn't ask for

## The Friday Afternoon Panic

It's 4pm. The Sales Director wants the forecast.
You spend 2 hours in Excel.
Let's stop doing that.

### 1. The "State of the Union" Prompt
Export your pipeline to CSV.
**Prompt**:
> "Act as a Sales Director. Analyse this pipeline.
> 1. What is the total weighted pipeline for Q4?
> 2. Which 3 deals are most likely to slip based on the 'Last Activity' date?
> 3. Write a 3-bullet summary for the executive team."

### 2. Forecasting with AI
AI is better at probability than you are.
It looks at historical win rates, not your optimism.
**Analysis**:
> "Based on our historical win rate of 20% for 'Cold Outbound' leads, and 40% for 'Referrals', recalculate the expected revenue for this month."

### 3. Churn Prediction
For Account Managers.
Feed usage data (if available) or support ticket volume into the AI.
**Pattern**:
High Support Tickets + Low Login Activity = **Churn Risk**.
AI flags this account for an immediate "Success Call".

## Practical Exercise: The Board Report

### Task
Imagine you have to present to the Board tomorrow.
1.  **Generate**: Create a visual report (using a tool or describing the charts) of your current performance.
2.  **Narrative**: Ask AI to write the "Story" behind the numbers. "Why are we up/down?"
3.  **Strategy**: "Based on these numbers, what should be our focus for next week?"

### Questions to Consider
-   Was the AI's forecast lower than yours? (It usually is).
-   Did the narrative sound convincing?
-   How much stress did this save you?

## Next Steps

You've mastered the Sales Admin track.
You sell more, type less.
