# AI Tools: Best Practices & Standard Operating Procedures

This module covers best practices and standard operating procedures for the most commonly used AI tools at TBS Digital Labs.

---

## Security First: Universal Rules

Before using any AI tool, follow these universal security practices:

### Rule 1: Never Share Secrets

**Never share with AI tools:**
- API keys, passwords, or authentication tokens
- Client data or personal information
- Proprietary business logic or trade secrets
- Database credentials or connection strings
- Private keys or certificates
- Internal URLs or system architecture details

**Safe to share:**
- Public code patterns
- Generic examples
- Error messages (scrubbed of sensitive context)
- General programming questions
- Public documentation or examples

**Remember:** If you wouldn't post it on a public forum, don't share it with AI.

---

## Security First: Review Everything

AI-generated content often works, but it's not always correct, secure, or appropriate.

**Always review:**
- Code for security vulnerabilities
- Content for accuracy and brand compliance
- Suggestions for appropriateness
- Outputs for edge cases or errors

**The rule:** If you can't verify it, don't use it.
