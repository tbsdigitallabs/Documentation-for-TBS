# Personal Admin Automation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Triage your email inbox in minutes using AI
- Automate your calendar scheduling and protection
- Summarise long threads and documents instantly
- Reclaim 5+ hours of your week for "Deep Work"

## The "Admin Tax"

We all pay it. Scheduling, emailing, filing, searching.
It's the friction that slows us down.
Let's grease the wheels.

### 1. Email Triage
**The Problem**: 50 unread emails.
**The AI Fix**:
> "I'm going to paste 5 emails.
> Draft a short, polite reply for each.
> If it's a newsletter, just say 'Summary: [One Sentence]'.
> If it requires action, flag it as 'URGENT'."

### 2. Calendar Defence
**The Problem**: "Do you have time for a quick chat?"
**The AI Fix**:
Use tools like **Reclaim.ai** or **Motion** (which integrate with Google Calendar).
Or use AI to plan your day:
> "Here is my to-do list and my meetings.
> Create a schedule for me.
> Block out 2 hours for Deep Work in the morning.
> Group all small tasks into a 'Power Hour' after lunch."

### 3. The "TL;DR" Button
**The Problem**: A 50-page PDF attachment.
**The AI Fix**:
Upload to Gemini/Claude.
> "Summarise this document.
> What are the 3 things I actually need to know?
> Are there any deadlines mentioned?"

## Practical Exercise: The Time Audit

### Task
1.  **Audit**: Look at your calendar for last week.
2.  **Identify**: Find the "Admin Bloat" (tasks that required low brain power).
3.  **Automate**: Pick ONE of those tasks and build an AI workflow to solve it (e.g., a template for weekly updates).

### Questions to Consider
-   How much time did you spend on email last week?
-   Did the AI summary miss anything important?
-   How does it feel to have a "Deep Work" block protected?

## Next Steps

You have completed the Shared Admin track.
You are now the master of your own time.
