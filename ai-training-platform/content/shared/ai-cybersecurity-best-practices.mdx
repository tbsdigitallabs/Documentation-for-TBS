# AI Cybersecurity Best Practices

Welcome to one of the most critical modules in this training platform. As we integrate AI tools into our workflows, we must balance innovation with security. This isn't about avoiding AI—it's about using it intelligently and safely.

**This module will teach you:** How to leverage AI tools effectively while protecting TBS Digital Labs' intellectual property, client data, and proprietary information. Think of it as learning to drive safely—you don't avoid cars, you learn the rules of the road.

*'AI Tools: *powerful and useful* Company IP: *valuable and sensitive* You: *using both safely* Also you: This is how professionals do it!'*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Identify what data is safe to share with AI tools and what isn't
- Implement secure testing environments for AI integration
- Apply data sanitisation techniques before using public AI tools
- Choose between public and enterprise AI solutions appropriately
- Establish secure workflows for AI-assisted development and content creation
- Understand the legal and compliance implications of AI data sharing

---

## The Core Principle: Secure Testing, Not Abstinence

**We don't avoid AI—we use it safely.**

The goal isn't to ban AI tools from our workflows. Instead, we create secure testing environments where we can safely experiment, validate, and integrate AI capabilities without risking our intellectual property or client data.

### Why This Matters

- **Protect Company IP**: Our proprietary processes, algorithms, and strategies stay confidential
- **Client Confidentiality**: Client data, project details, and sensitive information remain protected
- **Compliance**: Meet legal and regulatory requirements for data handling
- **Competitive Advantage**: Keep our unique approaches and innovations secure

---

## What Should NEVER Be Shared with Public AI Tools

### Critical Data Categories

**1. Credentials & Authentication**
- API keys, tokens, passwords
- Database connection strings
- OAuth secrets and private keys
- Authentication credentials of any kind

**2. Client Information**
- Client names, contact details, or identifying information
- Project specifics, budgets, timelines
- Client communications or meeting notes
- Any data covered by NDAs or confidentiality agreements

**3. Proprietary Code & Algorithms**
- Unique algorithms or business logic
- Proprietary codebases or architecture
- Internal tools or systems
- Trade secrets or competitive advantages

**4. Financial Data**
- Pricing strategies or cost structures
- Revenue figures or financial projections
- Budget allocations or financial planning

**5. Personal Data**
- Employee personal information
- Client personal data (GDPR/privacy concerns)
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

---

## The Secure Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Create Isolated Test Environments

**Before integrating AI into any production workflow:**

<div className="grid gap-4 mt-4">

<div className="bg-surface-tertiary/50 p-4 rounded-xl border border-white/10">
**1. Set up a sandbox environment**
- Use non-production data
- Create synthetic test cases
- Use anonymised or dummy data that mirrors real structure
</div>

<div className="bg-surface-tertiary/50 p-4 rounded-xl border border-white/10">
**2. Test with non-sensitive examples**
- Generic code patterns (not your proprietary logic)
- Public domain content (not client-specific work)
- Example scenarios (not real project details)
</div>

<div className="bg-surface-tertiary/50 p-4 rounded-xl border border-white/10">
**3. Validate outputs carefully**
- Review all AI-generated content for accuracy
- Check for data leakage or unexpected outputs
- Verify the AI hasn't memorised or stored sensitive data
</div>

</div>

### Step 2: Data Sanitisation Techniques

**Before sharing ANY data with public AI tools:**

**For Code:**
- Remove API keys, credentials, and secrets
- Replace proprietary algorithms with generic patterns
- Use placeholder values instead of real data
- Remove client-specific identifiers

**For Content:**
- Anonymise client names and project details
- Use generic examples instead of real scenarios
- Remove financial figures or sensitive metrics
- Strip out any identifying information

**For Documents:**
- Redact sensitive sections before sharing
- Use summaries instead of full documents
- Extract only the specific information needed
- Never share entire documents containing IP

### Step 3: Choose the Right Tool for the Job

**Public AI Tools** (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- ✅ Safe for: Generic questions, public domain content, learning
- ❌ Never use for: Sensitive data, proprietary code, client information

**Enterprise AI Solutions** (On-premise, private instances)
- ✅ Use for: Sensitive IP, client data, proprietary workflows
- ✅ Benefits: Data stays within your infrastructure, compliance-friendly

**Self-Hosted AI** (Local models, private deployments)
- ✅ Use for: Highly sensitive work, maximum control
- ✅ Benefits: Complete data isolation, no external sharing

- **Control**: You control data retention and deletion policies
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security and access controls
- **Support**: Dedicated support and customisation options

---

## The Secure AI Integration Checklist

Before using any AI tool with company-related work, ask:

- **Is this data sensitive?** (IP, client data, proprietary info)
- **Have I sanitised the data?** (Removed credentials, identifiers, sensitive details)
- **Am I using the right tool?** (Public vs enterprise vs self-hosted)
- **Have I tested in isolation?** (Sandbox environment, non-production data)
- **Can I verify the output?** (Review for accuracy and data leakage)
- **Is this compliant?** (Meets legal and regulatory requirements)

**If any answer is uncertain, use enterprise solutions or consult with security/compliance teams.**

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ "It's Just Code"
**Reality**: Code contains business logic, architecture decisions, and sometimes credentials. Even "harmless" code can reveal proprietary approaches.

### ❌ "I'll Remove Sensitive Data Later"
**Reality**: Once shared, data may be stored in AI training data. Prevention is better than cleanup.

### ❌ "It's Just for Learning"
**Reality**: Learning examples can still leak sensitive patterns or approaches. Use generic examples.

### ❌ "The AI Said It's Secure"
**Reality**: Public AI tools explicitly state they may use your data for training. Always assume data is not private.

### ❌ "I'll Use It Once and Delete"
**Reality**: Data shared with public AI tools may be retained and used for training. Deletion doesn't guarantee removal from training data.
