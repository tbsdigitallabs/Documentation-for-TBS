|---------------------|----------|
| How AI works behind the scenes | The platform handles all that for you |
| Database management | Everything saves automatically |

| Coding or programming | The system is point-and-click |
| Technical jargon | This guide uses plain English only |

|-------------------|------|
| Your work Google account | You'll need it to log in |

## What Is LearningLab?

**In plain English:** LearningLab is an online training platform where TBS Digital Labs team members learn how to use AI tools in their jobs.

Think of it like:
- Netflix for training videos → but with slides and quizzes
- LinkedIn Learning → but specifically for our team and AI tools
- A video game → where people earn points and level up as they complete training

### Who Uses It?

| Role | What They Learn |
|------|-----------------|
| Developers | AI coding tools, automation, testing |
| Designers | AI design tools, asset generation |
| Project Managers | AI for planning, meetings, workflows |
| Content Creators | AI for writing, video, PR |
| Sales & Business Dev | AI for leads, CRM, reporting |

### How It Works (The Big Picture)

1. **Team member logs in** → using their work Google account
2. **They pick their role** → Developer, Designer, PM, etc.
3. **They complete foundation training** → Everyone does this first
4. **They access role-specific modules** → Training tailored to their job
5. **They earn XP and level up** → Gamification keeps it fun
6. **They appear on the leaderboard** → Friendly competition
